<h1>Of Human Bondage</h1>

<h2 class="no-break">by W. Somerset Maugham</h2>

<hr />

<div class="chapter">

<h2>I</h2>

<p>
The day broke gray and dull. The clouds hung heavily, and there was a rawness
in the air that suggested snow. A woman servant came into a room in which a
child was sleeping and drew the curtains. She glanced mechanically at the house
opposite, a stucco house with a portico, and went to the child&rsquo;s bed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wake up, Philip,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
She pulled down the bed-clothes, took him in her arms, and carried him
downstairs. He was only half awake.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your mother wants you,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
She opened the door of a room on the floor below and took the child over to a
bed in which a woman was lying. It was his mother. She stretched out her arms,
and the child nestled by her side. He did not ask why he had been awakened. The
woman kissed his eyes, and with thin, small hands felt the warm body through
his white flannel nightgown. She pressed him closer to herself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you sleepy, darling?&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
Her voice was so weak that it seemed to come already from a great distance. The
child did not answer, but smiled comfortably. He was very happy in the large,
warm bed, with those soft arms about him. He tried to make himself smaller
still as he cuddled up against his mother, and he kissed her sleepily. In a
moment he closed his eyes and was fast asleep. The doctor came forwards and
stood by the bed-side.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t take him away yet,&rdquo; she moaned.
</p>

<p>
The doctor, without answering, looked at her gravely. Knowing she would not be
allowed to keep the child much longer, the woman kissed him again; and she
passed her hand down his body till she came to his feet; she held the right
foot in her hand and felt the five small toes; and then slowly passed her hand
over the left one. She gave a sob.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
tired.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She shook her head, unable to speak, and the tears rolled down her cheeks. The
doctor bent down.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me take him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She was too weak to resist his wish, and she gave the child up. The doctor
handed him back to his nurse.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better put him back in his own bed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well, sir.&rdquo; The little boy, still sleeping, was taken away.
His mother sobbed now broken-heartedly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What will happen to him, poor child?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The monthly nurse tried to quiet her, and presently, from exhaustion, the
crying ceased. The doctor walked to a table on the other side of the room, upon
which, under a towel, lay the body of a still-born child. He lifted the towel
and looked. He was hidden from the bed by a screen, but the woman guessed what
he was doing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Was it a girl or a boy?&rdquo; she whispered to the nurse.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Another boy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The woman did not answer. In a moment the child&rsquo;s nurse came back. She
approached the bed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Master Philip never woke up,&rdquo; she said. There was a pause. Then
the doctor felt his patient&rsquo;s pulse once more.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything I can do just now,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call again after breakfast.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you out, sir,&rdquo; said the child&rsquo;s nurse.
</p>

<p>
They walked downstairs in silence. In the hall the doctor stopped.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve sent for Mrs. Carey&rsquo;s brother-in-law, haven&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you know at what time he&rsquo;ll be here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, sir, I&rsquo;m expecting a telegram.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What about the little boy? I should think he&rsquo;d be better out of
the way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Miss Watkin said she&rsquo;d take him, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s she?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s his godmother, sir. D&rsquo;you think Mrs. Carey will get
over it, sir?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The doctor shook his head.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>II</h2>

<p>
It was a week later. Philip was sitting on the floor in the drawing-room at
Miss Watkin&rsquo;s house in Onslow gardens. He was an only child and used to
amusing himself. The room was filled with massive furniture, and on each of the
sofas were three big cushions. There was a cushion too in each arm-chair. All
these he had taken and, with the help of the gilt rout chairs, light and easy
to move, had made an elaborate cave in which he could hide himself from the Red
Indians who were lurking behind the curtains. He put his ear to the floor and
listened to the herd of buffaloes that raced across the prairie. Presently,
hearing the door open, he held his breath so that he might not be discovered;
but a violent hand pulled away a chair and the cushions fell down.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You naughty boy, Miss Watkin WILL be cross with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hulloa, Emma!&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
The nurse bent down and kissed him, then began to shake out the cushions, and
put them back in their places.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Am I to come home?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve come to fetch you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a new dress on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was in eighteen-eighty-five, and she wore a bustle. Her gown was of black
velvet, with tight sleeves and sloping shoulders, and the skirt had three large
flounces. She wore a black bonnet with velvet strings. She hesitated. The
question she had expected did not come, and so she could not give the answer
she had prepared.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to ask how your mamma is?&rdquo; she said at
length.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I forgot. How is mamma?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Now she was ready.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your mamma is quite well and happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I am glad.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your mamma&rsquo;s gone away. You won&rsquo;t ever see her any
more.&rdquo; Philip did not know what she meant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your mamma&rsquo;s in heaven.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She began to cry, and Philip, though he did not quite understand, cried too.
Emma was a tall, big-boned woman, with fair hair and large features. She came
from Devonshire and, notwithstanding her many years of service in London, had
never lost the breadth of her accent. Her tears increased her emotion, and she
pressed the little boy to her heart. She felt vaguely the pity of that child
deprived of the only love in the world that is quite unselfish. It seemed
dreadful that he must be handed over to strangers. But in a little while she
pulled herself together.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your Uncle William is waiting in to see you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Go
and say good-bye to Miss Watkin, and we&rsquo;ll go home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to say good-bye,&rdquo; he answered, instinctively
anxious to hide his tears.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well, run upstairs and get your hat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He fetched it, and when he came down Emma was waiting for him in the hall. He
heard the sound of voices in the study behind the dining-room. He paused. He
knew that Miss Watkin and her sister were talking to friends, and it seemed to
him&mdash;he was nine years old&mdash;that if he went in they would be sorry
for him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go and say good-bye to Miss Watkin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better,&rdquo; said Emma.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go in and tell them I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
He wished to make the most of his opportunity. Emma knocked at the door and
walked in. He heard her speak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Master Philip wants to say good-bye to you, miss.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a sudden hush of the conversation, and Philip limped in. Henrietta
Watkin was a stout woman, with a red face and dyed hair. In those days to dye
the hair excited comment, and Philip had heard much gossip at home when his
godmother&rsquo;s changed colour. She lived with an elder sister, who had
resigned herself contentedly to old age. Two ladies, whom Philip did not know,
were calling, and they looked at him curiously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My poor child,&rdquo; said Miss Watkin, opening her arms.
</p>

<p>
She began to cry. Philip understood now why she had not been in to luncheon and
why she wore a black dress. She could not speak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go home,&rdquo; said Philip, at last.
</p>

<p>
He disengaged himself from Miss Watkin&rsquo;s arms, and she kissed him again.
Then he went to her sister and bade her good-bye too. One of the strange ladies
asked if she might kiss him, and he gravely gave her permission. Though crying,
he keenly enjoyed the sensation he was causing; he would have been glad to stay
a little longer to be made much of, but felt they expected him to go, so he
said that Emma was waiting for him. He went out of the room. Emma had gone
downstairs to speak with a friend in the basement, and he waited for her on the
landing. He heard Henrietta Watkin&rsquo;s voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;His mother was my greatest friend. I can&rsquo;t bear to think that
she&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to have gone to the funeral, Henrietta,&rdquo; said
her sister. &ldquo;I knew it would upset you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then one of the strangers spoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor little boy, it&rsquo;s dreadful to think of him quite alone in the
world. I see he limps.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s got a club-foot. It was such a grief to his
mother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then Emma came back. They called a hansom, and she told the driver where to go.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>III</h2>

<p>
When they reached the house Mrs. Carey had died in&mdash;it was in a dreary,
respectable street between Notting Hill Gate and High Street,
Kensington&mdash;Emma led Philip into the drawing-room. His uncle was writing
letters of thanks for the wreaths which had been sent. One of them, which had
arrived too late for the funeral, lay in its cardboard box on the hall-table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Master Philip,&rdquo; said Emma.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Carey stood up slowly and shook hands with the little boy. Then on second
thoughts he bent down and kissed his forehead. He was a man of somewhat less
than average height, inclined to corpulence, with his hair, worn long, arranged
over the scalp so as to conceal his baldness. He was clean-shaven. His features
were regular, and it was possible to imagine that in his youth he had been
good-looking. On his watch-chain he wore a gold cross.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to live with me now, Philip,&rdquo; said Mr. Carey.
&ldquo;Shall you like that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Two years before Philip had been sent down to stay at the vicarage after an
attack of chicken-pox; but there remained with him a recollection of an attic
and a large garden rather than of his uncle and aunt.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must look upon me and your Aunt Louisa as your father and
mother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The child&rsquo;s mouth trembled a little, he reddened, but did not answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your dear mother left you in my charge.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Carey had no great ease in expressing himself. When the news came that his
sister-in-law was dying, he set off at once for London, but on the way thought
of nothing but the disturbance in his life that would be caused if her death
forced him to undertake the care of her son. He was well over fifty, and his
wife, to whom he had been married for thirty years, was childless; he did not
look forward with any pleasure to the presence of a small boy who might be
noisy and rough. He had never much liked his sister-in-law.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take you down to Blackstable tomorrow,&rdquo; he
said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;With Emma?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The child put his hand in hers, and she pressed it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid Emma must go away,&rdquo; said Mr. Carey.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I want Emma to come with me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip began to cry, and the nurse could not help crying too. Mr. Carey looked
at them helplessly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better leave me alone with Master Philip for a
moment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very good, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Though Philip clung to her, she released herself gently. Mr. Carey took the boy
on his knee and put his arm round him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too old to
have a nurse now. We must see about sending you to school.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want Emma to come with me,&rdquo; the child repeated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It costs too much money, Philip. Your father didn&rsquo;t leave very
much, and I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s become of it. You must look at every
penny you spend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Carey had called the day before on the family solicitor. Philip&rsquo;s
father was a surgeon in good practice, and his hospital appointments suggested
an established position; so that it was a surprise on his sudden death from
blood-poisoning to find that he had left his widow little more than his life
insurance and what could be got for the lease of their house in Bruton Street.
This was six months ago; and Mrs. Carey, already in delicate health, finding
herself with child, had lost her head and accepted for the lease the first
offer that was made. She stored her furniture, and, at a rent which the parson
thought outrageous, took a furnished house for a year, so that she might suffer
from no inconvenience till her child was born. But she had never been used to
the management of money, and was unable to adapt her expenditure to her altered
circumstances. The little she had slipped through her fingers in one way and
another, so that now, when all expenses were paid, not much more than two
thousand pounds remained to support the boy till he was able to earn his own
living. It was impossible to explain all this to Philip and he was sobbing
still.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go to Emma,&rdquo; Mr. Carey said, feeling that she
could console the child better than anyone.
</p>

<p>
Without a word Philip slipped off his uncle&rsquo;s knee, but Mr. Carey stopped
him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We must go tomorrow, because on Saturday I&rsquo;ve got to prepare my
sermon, and you must tell Emma to get your things ready today. You can bring
all your toys. And if you want anything to remember your father and mother by
you can take one thing for each of them. Everything else is going to be
sold.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The boy slipped out of the room. Mr. Carey was unused to work, and he turned to
his correspondence with resentment. On one side of the desk was a bundle of
bills, and these filled him with irritation. One especially seemed
preposterous. Immediately after Mrs. Carey&rsquo;s death Emma had ordered from
the florist masses of white flowers for the room in which the dead woman lay.
It was sheer waste of money. Emma took far too much upon herself. Even if there
had been no financial necessity, he would have dismissed her.
</p>

<p>
But Philip went to her, and hid his face in her bosom, and wept as though his
heart would break. And she, feeling that he was almost her own son&mdash;she
had taken him when he was a month old&mdash;consoled him with soft words. She
promised that she would come and see him sometimes, and that she would never
forget him; and she told him about the country he was going to and about her
own home in Devonshire&mdash;her father kept a turnpike on the high-road that
led to Exeter, and there were pigs in the sty, and there was a cow, and the cow
had just had a calf&mdash;till Philip forgot his tears and grew excited at the
thought of his approaching journey. Presently she put him down, for there was
much to be done, and he helped her to lay out his clothes on the bed. She sent
him into the nursery to gather up his toys, and in a little while he was
playing happily.
</p>

<p>
But at last he grew tired of being alone and went back to the bed-room, in
which Emma was now putting his things into a big tin box; he remembered then
that his uncle had said he might take something to remember his father and
mother by. He told Emma and asked her what he should take.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go into the drawing-room and see what you
fancy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Uncle William&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind that. They&rsquo;re your own things now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip went downstairs slowly and found the door open. Mr. Carey had left the
room. Philip walked slowly round. They had been in the house so short a time
that there was little in it that had a particular interest to him. It was a
stranger&rsquo;s room, and Philip saw nothing that struck his fancy. But he
knew which were his mother&rsquo;s things and which belonged to the landlord,
and presently fixed on a little clock that he had once heard his mother say she
liked. With this he walked again rather disconsolately upstairs. Outside the
door of his mother&rsquo;s bed-room he stopped and listened. Though no one had
told him not to go in, he had a feeling that it would be wrong to do so; he was
a little frightened, and his heart beat uncomfortably; but at the same time
something impelled him to turn the handle. He turned it very gently, as if to
prevent anyone within from hearing, and then slowly pushed the door open. He
stood on the threshold for a moment before he had the courage to enter. He was
not frightened now, but it seemed strange. He closed the door behind him. The
blinds were drawn, and the room, in the cold light of a January afternoon, was
dark. On the dressing-table were Mrs. Carey&rsquo;s brushes and the hand
mirror. In a little tray were hairpins. There was a photograph of himself on
the chimney-piece and one of his father. He had often been in the room when his
mother was not in it, but now it seemed different. There was something curious
in the look of the chairs. The bed was made as though someone were going to
sleep in it that night, and in a case on the pillow was a night-dress.
</p>

<p>
Philip opened a large cupboard filled with dresses and, stepping in, took as
many of them as he could in his arms and buried his face in them. They smelt of
the scent his mother used. Then he pulled open the drawers, filled with his
mother&rsquo;s things, and looked at them: there were lavender bags among the
linen, and their scent was fresh and pleasant. The strangeness of the room left
it, and it seemed to him that his mother had just gone out for a walk. She
would be in presently and would come upstairs to have nursery tea with him. And
he seemed to feel her kiss on his lips.
</p>

<p>
It was not true that he would never see her again. It was not true simply
because it was impossible. He climbed up on the bed and put his head on the
pillow. He lay there quite still.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>IV</h2>

<p>
Philip parted from Emma with tears, but the journey to Blackstable amused him,
and, when they arrived, he was resigned and cheerful. Blackstable was sixty
miles from London. Giving their luggage to a porter, Mr. Carey set out to walk
with Philip to the vicarage; it took them little more than five minutes, and,
when they reached it, Philip suddenly remembered the gate. It was red and
five-barred: it swung both ways on easy hinges; and it was possible, though
forbidden, to swing backwards and forwards on it. They walked through the
garden to the front-door. This was only used by visitors and on Sundays, and on
special occasions, as when the Vicar went up to London or came back. The
traffic of the house took place through a side-door, and there was a back door
as well for the gardener and for beggars and tramps. It was a fairly large
house of yellow brick, with a red roof, built about five and twenty years
before in an ecclesiastical style. The front-door was like a church porch, and
the drawing-room windows were gothic.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Carey, knowing by what train they were coming, waited in the drawing-room
and listened for the click of the gate. When she heard it she went to the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Aunt Louisa,&rdquo; said Mr. Carey, when he saw her.
&ldquo;Run and give her a kiss.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip started to run, awkwardly, trailing his club-foot, and then stopped.
Mrs. Carey was a little, shrivelled woman of the same age as her husband, with
a face extraordinarily filled with deep wrinkles, and pale blue eyes. Her gray
hair was arranged in ringlets according to the fashion of her youth. She wore a
black dress, and her only ornament was a gold chain, from which hung a cross.
She had a shy manner and a gentle voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you walk, William?&rdquo; she said, almost reproachfully, as she
kissed her husband.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of it,&rdquo; he answered, with a glance at his
nephew.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t hurt you to walk, Philip, did it?&rdquo; she asked the
child.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. I always walk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was a little surprised at their conversation. Aunt Louisa told him to come
in, and they entered the hall. It was paved with red and yellow tiles, on which
alternately were a Greek Cross and the Lamb of God. An imposing staircase led
out of the hall. It was of polished pine, with a peculiar smell, and had been
put in because fortunately, when the church was reseated, enough wood remained
over. The balusters were decorated with emblems of the Four Evangelists.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had the stove lighted as I thought you&rsquo;d be cold after
your journey,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carey.
</p>

<p>
It was a large black stove that stood in the hall and was only lighted if the
weather was very bad and the Vicar had a cold. It was not lighted if Mrs. Carey
had a cold. Coal was expensive. Besides, Mary Ann, the maid, didn&rsquo;t like
fires all over the place. If they wanted all them fires they must keep a second
girl. In the winter Mr. and Mrs. Carey lived in the dining-room so that one
fire should do, and in the summer they could not get out of the habit, so the
drawing-room was used only by Mr. Carey on Sunday afternoons for his nap. But
every Saturday he had a fire in the study so that he could write his sermon.
</p>

<p>
Aunt Louisa took Philip upstairs and showed him into a tiny bed-room that
looked out on the drive. Immediately in front of the window was a large tree,
which Philip remembered now because the branches were so low that it was
possible to climb quite high up it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A small room for a small boy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carey. &ldquo;You
won&rsquo;t be frightened at sleeping alone?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
On his first visit to the vicarage he had come with his nurse, and Mrs. Carey
had had little to do with him. She looked at him now with some uncertainty.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can you wash your own hands, or shall I wash them for you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can wash myself,&rdquo; he answered firmly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I shall look at them when you come down to tea,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Carey.
</p>

<p>
She knew nothing about children. After it was settled that Philip should come
down to Blackstable, Mrs. Carey had thought much how she should treat him; she
was anxious to do her duty; but now he was there she found herself just as shy
of him as he was of her. She hoped he would not be noisy and rough, because her
husband did not like rough and noisy boys. Mrs. Carey made an excuse to leave
Philip alone, but in a moment came back and knocked at the door; she asked him,
without coming in, if he could pour out the water himself. Then she went
downstairs and rang the bell for tea.
</p>

<p>
The dining-room, large and well-proportioned, had windows on two sides of it,
with heavy curtains of red rep; there was a big table in the middle; and at one
end an imposing mahogany sideboard with a looking-glass in it. In one corner
stood a harmonium. On each side of the fireplace were chairs covered in stamped
leather, each with an antimacassar; one had arms and was called the husband,
and the other had none and was called the wife. Mrs. Carey never sat in the
arm-chair: she said she preferred a chair that was not too comfortable; there
was always a lot to do, and if her chair had had arms she might not be so ready
to leave it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Carey was making up the fire when Philip came in, and he pointed out to his
nephew that there were two pokers. One was large and bright and polished and
unused, and was called the Vicar; and the other, which was much smaller and had
evidently passed through many fires, was called the Curate.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are we waiting for?&rdquo; said Mr. Carey.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I told Mary Ann to make you an egg. I thought you&rsquo;d be hungry
after your journey.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Carey thought the journey from London to Blackstable very tiring. She
seldom travelled herself, for the living was only three hundred a year, and,
when her husband wanted a holiday, since there was not money for two, he went
by himself. He was very fond of Church Congresses and usually managed to go up
to London once a year; and once he had been to Paris for the exhibition, and
two or three times to Switzerland. Mary Ann brought in the egg, and they sat
down. The chair was much too low for Philip, and for a moment neither Mr. Carey
nor his wife knew what to do.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put some books under him,&rdquo; said Mary Ann.
</p>

<p>
She took from the top of the harmonium the large Bible and the prayer-book from
which the Vicar was accustomed to read prayers, and put them on Philip&rsquo;s
chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, William, he can&rsquo;t sit on the Bible,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carey, in
a shocked tone. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you get him some books out of the
study?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Carey considered the question for an instant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it matters this once if you put the prayer-book on
the top, Mary Ann,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The book of Common Prayer is the
composition of men like ourselves. It has no claim to divine authorship.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that, William,&rdquo; said Aunt Louisa.
</p>

<p>
Philip perched himself on the books, and the Vicar, having said grace, cut the
top off his egg.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, handing it to Philip, &ldquo;you can eat my top
if you like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip would have liked an egg to himself, but he was not offered one, so took
what he could.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How have the chickens been laying since I went away?&rdquo; asked the
Vicar.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;ve been dreadful, only one or two a day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How did you like that top, Philip?&rdquo; asked his uncle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very much, thank you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You shall have another one on Sunday afternoon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Carey always had a boiled egg at tea on Sunday, so that he might be
fortified for the evening service.

<p>
Philip came gradually to know the people he was to live with, and by fragments
of conversation, some of it not meant for his ears, learned a good deal both
about himself and about his dead parents. Philip&rsquo;s father had been much
younger than the Vicar of Blackstable. After a brilliant career at St.
Luke&rsquo;s Hospital he was put on the staff, and presently began to earn
money in considerable sums. He spent it freely. When the parson set about
restoring his church and asked his brother for a subscription, he was surprised
by receiving a couple of hundred pounds: Mr. Carey, thrifty by inclination and
economical by necessity, accepted it with mingled feelings; he was envious of
his brother because he could afford to give so much, pleased for the sake of
his church, and vaguely irritated by a generosity which seemed almost
ostentatious. Then Henry Carey married a patient, a beautiful girl but
penniless, an orphan with no near relations, but of good family; and there was
an array of fine friends at the wedding. The parson, on his visits to her when
he came to London, held himself with reserve. He felt shy with her and in his
heart he resented her great beauty: she dressed more magnificently than became
the wife of a hardworking surgeon; and the charming furniture of her house, the
flowers among which she lived even in winter, suggested an extravagance which
he deplored. He heard her talk of entertainments she was going to; and, as he
told his wife on getting home again, it was impossible to accept hospitality
without making some return. He had seen grapes in the dining-room that must
have cost at least eight shillings a pound; and at luncheon he had been given
asparagus two months before it was ready in the vicarage garden. Now all he had
anticipated was come to pass: the Vicar felt the satisfaction of the prophet
who saw fire and brimstone consume the city which would not mend its way to his
warning. Poor Philip was practically penniless, and what was the good of his
mother&rsquo;s fine friends now? He heard that his father&rsquo;s extravagance
was really criminal, and it was a mercy that Providence had seen fit to take
his dear mother to itself: she had no more idea of money than a child.
</p>

<p>
When Philip had been a week at Blackstable an incident happened which seemed to
irritate his uncle very much. One morning he found on the breakfast table a
small packet which had been sent on by post from the late Mrs. Carey&rsquo;s
house in London. It was addressed to her. When the parson opened it he found a
dozen photographs of Mrs. Carey. They showed the head and shoulders only, and
her hair was more plainly done than usual, low on the forehead, which gave her
an unusual look; the face was thin and worn, but no illness could impair the
beauty of her features. There was in the large dark eyes a sadness which Philip
did not remember. The first sight of the dead woman gave Mr. Carey a little
shock, but this was quickly followed by perplexity. The photographs seemed
quite recent, and he could not imagine who had ordered them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you know anything about these, Philip?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I remember mamma said she&rsquo;d been taken,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;Miss Watkin scolded her…. She said: I wanted the boy to have something
to remember me by when he grows up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Carey looked at Philip for an instant. The child spoke in a clear treble.
He recalled the words, but they meant nothing to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better take one of the photographs and keep it in your
room,&rdquo; said Mr. Carey. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put the others away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He sent one to Miss Watkin, and she wrote and explained how they came to be
taken.
</p>

<p>
One day Mrs. Carey was lying in bed, but she was feeling a little better than
usual, and the doctor in the morning had seemed hopeful; Emma had taken the
child out, and the maids were downstairs in the basement: suddenly Mrs. Carey
felt desperately alone in the world. A great fear seized her that she would not
recover from the confinement which she was expecting in a fortnight. Her son
was nine years old. How could he be expected to remember her? She could not
bear to think that he would grow up and forget, forget her utterly; and she had
loved him so passionately, because he was weakly and deformed, and because he
was her child. She had no photographs of herself taken since her marriage, and
that was ten years before. She wanted her son to know what she looked like at
the end. He could not forget her then, not forget utterly. She knew that if she
called her maid and told her she wanted to get up, the maid would prevent her,
and perhaps send for the doctor, and she had not the strength now to struggle
or argue. She got out of bed and began to dress herself. She had been on her
back so long that her legs gave way beneath her, and then the soles of her feet
tingled so that she could hardly bear to put them to the ground. But she went
on. She was unused to doing her own hair and, when she raised her arms and
began to brush it, she felt faint. She could never do it as her maid did. It
was beautiful hair, very fine, and of a deep rich gold. Her eyebrows were
straight and dark. She put on a black skirt, but chose the bodice of the
evening dress which she liked best: it was of a white damask which was
fashionable in those days. She looked at herself in the glass. Her face was
very pale, but her skin was clear: she had never had much colour, and this had
always made the redness of her beautiful mouth emphatic. She could not restrain
a sob. But she could not afford to be sorry for herself; she was feeling
already desperately tired; and she put on the furs which Henry had given her
the Christmas before&mdash;she had been so proud of them and so happy
then&mdash;and slipped downstairs with beating heart. She got safely out of the
house and drove to a photographer. She paid for a dozen photographs. She was
obliged to ask for a glass of water in the middle of the sitting; and the
assistant, seeing she was ill, suggested that she should come another day, but
she insisted on staying till the end. At last it was finished, and she drove
back again to the dingy little house in Kensington which she hated with all her
heart. It was a horrible house to die in.
</p>

<p>
She found the front door open, and when she drove up the maid and Emma ran down
the steps to help her. They had been frightened when they found her room empty.
At first they thought she must have gone to Miss Watkin, and the cook was sent
round. Miss Watkin came back with her and was waiting anxiously in the
drawing-room. She came downstairs now full of anxiety and reproaches; but the
exertion had been more than Mrs. Carey was fit for, and when the occasion for
firmness no longer existed she gave way. She fell heavily into Emma&rsquo;s
arms and was carried upstairs. She remained unconscious for a time that seemed
incredibly long to those that watched her, and the doctor, hurriedly sent for,
did not come. It was next day, when she was a little better, that Miss Watkin
got some explanation out of her. Philip was playing on the floor of his
mother&rsquo;s bed-room, and neither of the ladies paid attention to him. He
only understood vaguely what they were talking about, and he could not have
said why those words remained in his memory.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wanted the boy to have something to remember me by when he grows
up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make out why she ordered a dozen,&rdquo; said Mr. Carey.
&ldquo;Two would have done.&rdquo;
</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<p>
One day was very like another at the vicarage.
</p>

<p>
Soon after breakfast Mary Ann brought in The Times. Mr. Carey shared it with
two neighbours. He had it from ten till one, when the gardener took it over to
Mr. Ellis at the Limes, with whom it remained till seven; then it was taken to
Miss Brooks at the Manor House, who, since she got it late, had the advantage
of keeping it. In summer Mrs. Carey, when she was making jam, often asked her
for a copy to cover the pots with. When the Vicar settled down to his paper his
wife put on her bonnet and went out to do the shopping. Philip accompanied her.
Blackstable was a fishing village. It consisted of a high street in which were
the shops, the bank, the doctor&rsquo;s house, and the houses of two or three
coalship owners; round the little harbor were shabby streets in which lived
fishermen and poor people; but since they went to chapel they were of no
account. When Mrs. Carey passed the dissenting ministers in the street she
stepped over to the other side to avoid meeting them, but if there was not time
for this fixed her eyes on the pavement. It was a scandal to which the Vicar
had never resigned himself that there were three chapels in the High Street: he
could not help feeling that the law should have stepped in to prevent their
erection. Shopping in Blackstable was not a simple matter; for dissent, helped
by the fact that the parish church was two miles from the town, was very
common; and it was necessary to deal only with churchgoers; Mrs. Carey knew
perfectly that the vicarage custom might make all the difference to a
tradesman&rsquo;s faith. There were two butchers who went to church, and they
would not understand that the Vicar could not deal with both of them at once;
nor were they satisfied with his simple plan of going for six months to one and
for six months to the other. The butcher who was not sending meat to the
vicarage constantly threatened not to come to church, and the Vicar was
sometimes obliged to make a threat: it was very wrong of him not to come to
church, but if he carried iniquity further and actually went to chapel, then of
course, excellent as his meat was, Mr. Carey would be forced to leave him for
ever. Mrs. Carey often stopped at the bank to deliver a message to Josiah
Graves, the manager, who was choir-master, treasurer, and churchwarden. He was
a tall, thin man with a sallow face and a long nose; his hair was very white,
and to Philip he seemed extremely old. He kept the parish accounts, arranged
the treats for the choir and the schools; though there was no organ in the
parish church, it was generally considered (in Blackstable) that the choir he
led was the best in Kent; and when there was any ceremony, such as a visit from
the Bishop for confirmation or from the Rural Dean to preach at the Harvest
Thanksgiving, he made the necessary preparations. But he had no hesitation in
doing all manner of things without more than a perfunctory consultation with
the Vicar, and the Vicar, though always ready to be saved trouble, much
resented the churchwarden&rsquo;s managing ways. He really seemed to look upon
himself as the most important person in the parish. Mr. Carey constantly told
his wife that if Josiah Graves did not take care he would give him a good rap
over the knuckles one day; but Mrs. Carey advised him to bear with Josiah
Graves: he meant well, and it was not his fault if he was not quite a
gentleman. The Vicar, finding his comfort in the practice of a Christian
virtue, exercised forbearance; but he revenged himself by calling the
churchwarden Bismarck behind his back.
</p>

<p>
Once there had been a serious quarrel between the pair, and Mrs. Carey still
thought of that anxious time with dismay. The Conservative candidate had
announced his intention of addressing a meeting at Blackstable; and Josiah
Graves, having arranged that it should take place in the Mission Hall, went to
Mr. Carey and told him that he hoped he would say a few words. It appeared that
the candidate had asked Josiah Graves to take the chair. This was more than Mr.
Carey could put up with. He had firm views upon the respect which was due to
the cloth, and it was ridiculous for a churchwarden to take the chair at a
meeting when the Vicar was there. He reminded Josiah Graves that parson meant
person, that is, the vicar was the person of the parish. Josiah Graves answered
that he was the first to recognise the dignity of the church, but this was a
matter of politics, and in his turn he reminded the Vicar that their Blessed
Saviour had enjoined upon them to render unto Caesar the things that were
Caesar&rsquo;s. To this Mr. Carey replied that the devil could quote scripture
to his purpose, himself had sole authority over the Mission Hall, and if he
were not asked to be chairman he would refuse the use of it for a political
meeting. Josiah Graves told Mr. Carey that he might do as he chose, and for his
part he thought the Wesleyan Chapel would be an equally suitable place. Then
Mr. Carey said that if Josiah Graves set foot in what was little better than a
heathen temple he was not fit to be churchwarden in a Christian parish. Josiah
Graves thereupon resigned all his offices, and that very evening sent to the
church for his cassock and surplice. His sister, Miss Graves, who kept house
for him, gave up her secretaryship of the Maternity Club, which provided the
pregnant poor with flannel, baby linen, coals, and five shillings. Mr. Carey
said he was at last master in his own house. But soon he found that he was
obliged to see to all sorts of things that he knew nothing about; and Josiah
Graves, after the first moment of irritation, discovered that he had lost his
chief interest in life. Mrs. Carey and Miss Graves were much distressed by the
quarrel; they met after a discreet exchange of letters, and made up their minds
to put the matter right: they talked, one to her husband, the other to her
brother, from morning till night; and since they were persuading these
gentlemen to do what in their hearts they wanted, after three weeks of anxiety
a reconciliation was effected. It was to both their interests, but they
ascribed it to a common love for their Redeemer. The meeting was held at the
Mission Hall, and the doctor was asked to be chairman. Mr. Carey and Josiah
Graves both made speeches.
</p>

<p>
When Mrs. Carey had finished her business with the banker, she generally went
upstairs to have a little chat with his sister; and while the ladies talked of
parish matters, the curate or the new bonnet of Mrs. Wilson&mdash;Mr. Wilson
was the richest man in Blackstable, he was thought to have at least five
hundred a year, and he had married his cook&mdash;Philip sat demurely in the
stiff parlour, used only to receive visitors, and busied himself with the
restless movements of goldfish in a bowl. The windows were never opened except
to air the room for a few minutes in the morning, and it had a stuffy smell
which seemed to Philip to have a mysterious connection with banking.
</p>

<p>
Then Mrs. Carey remembered that she had to go to the grocer, and they continued
their way. When the shopping was done they often went down a side street of
little houses, mostly of wood, in which fishermen dwelt (and here and there a
fisherman sat on his doorstep mending his nets, and nets hung to dry upon the
doors), till they came to a small beach, shut in on each side by warehouses,
but with a view of the sea. Mrs. Carey stood for a few minutes and looked at
it, it was turbid and yellow, [and who knows what thoughts passed through her
mind?] while Philip searched for flat stones to play ducks and drakes. Then
they walked slowly back. They looked into the post office to get the right
time, nodded to Mrs. Wigram the doctor&rsquo;s wife, who sat at her window
sewing, and so got home.
</p>

<p>
Dinner was at one o&rsquo;clock; and on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday it
consisted of beef, roast, hashed, and minced, and on Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday of mutton. On Sunday they ate one of their own chickens. In the
afternoon Philip did his lessons, He was taught Latin and mathematics by his
uncle who knew neither, and French and the piano by his aunt. Of French she was
ignorant, but she knew the piano well enough to accompany the old-fashioned
songs she had sung for thirty years. Uncle William used to tell Philip that
when he was a curate his wife had known twelve songs by heart, which she could
sing at a moment&rsquo;s notice whenever she was asked. She often sang still
when there was a tea-party at the vicarage. There were few people whom the
Careys cared to ask there, and their parties consisted always of the curate,
Josiah Graves with his sister, Dr. Wigram and his wife. After tea Miss Graves
played one or two of Mendelssohn&rsquo;s Songs without Words, and Mrs. Carey
sang When the Swallows Homeward Fly, or Trot, Trot, My Pony.
</p>

<p>
But the Careys did not give tea-parties often; the preparations upset them, and
when their guests were gone they felt themselves exhausted. They preferred to
have tea by themselves, and after tea they played backgammon. Mrs. Carey
arranged that her husband should win, because he did not like losing. They had
cold supper at eight. It was a scrappy meal because Mary Ann resented getting
anything ready after tea, and Mrs. Carey helped to clear away. Mrs. Carey
seldom ate more than bread and butter, with a little stewed fruit to follow,
but the Vicar had a slice of cold meat. Immediately after supper Mrs. Carey
rang the bell for prayers, and then Philip went to bed. He rebelled against
being undressed by Mary Ann and after a while succeeded in establishing his
right to dress and undress himself. At nine o&rsquo;clock Mary Ann brought in
the eggs and the plate. Mrs. Carey wrote the date on each egg and put the
number down in a book. She then took the plate-basket on her arm and went
upstairs. Mr. Carey continued to read one of his old books, but as the clock
struck ten he got up, put out the lamps, and followed his wife to bed.
</p>

<p>
When Philip arrived there was some difficulty in deciding on which evening he
should have his bath. It was never easy to get plenty of hot water, since the
kitchen boiler did not work, and it was impossible for two persons to have a
bath on the same day. The only man who had a bathroom in Blackstable was Mr.
Wilson, and it was thought ostentatious of him. Mary Ann had her bath in the
kitchen on Monday night, because she liked to begin the week clean. Uncle
William could not have his on Saturday, because he had a heavy day before him
and he was always a little tired after a bath, so he had it on Friday. Mrs.
Carey had hers on Thursday for the same reason. It looked as though Saturday
were naturally indicated for Philip, but Mary Ann said she couldn&rsquo;t keep
the fire up on Saturday night: what with all the cooking on Sunday, having to
make pastry and she didn&rsquo;t know what all, she did not feel up to giving
the boy his bath on Saturday night; and it was quite clear that he could not
bath himself. Mrs. Carey was shy about bathing a boy, and of course the Vicar
had his sermon. But the Vicar insisted that Philip should be clean and sweet
for the lord&rsquo;s Day. Mary Ann said she would rather go than be put
upon&mdash;and after eighteen years she didn&rsquo;t expect to have more work
given her, and they might show some consideration&mdash;and Philip said he
didn&rsquo;t want anyone to bath him, but could very well bath himself. This
settled it. Mary Ann said she was quite sure he wouldn&rsquo;t bath himself
properly, and rather than he should go dirty&mdash;and not because he was going
into the presence of the Lord, but because she couldn&rsquo;t abide a boy who
wasn&rsquo;t properly washed&mdash;she&rsquo;d work herself to the bone even if
it was Saturday night.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>VII</h2>

<p>
Sunday was a day crowded with incident. Mr. Carey was accustomed to say that he
was the only man in his parish who worked seven days a week.
</p>

<p>
The household got up half an hour earlier than usual. No lying abed for a poor
parson on the day of rest, Mr. Carey remarked as Mary Ann knocked at the door
punctually at eight. It took Mrs. Carey longer to dress, and she got down to
breakfast at nine, a little breathless, only just before her husband. Mr.
Carey&rsquo;s boots stood in front of the fire to warm. Prayers were longer
than usual, and the breakfast more substantial. After breakfast the Vicar cut
thin slices of bread for the communion, and Philip was privileged to cut off
the crust. He was sent to the study to fetch a marble paperweight, with which
Mr. Carey pressed the bread till it was thin and pulpy, and then it was cut
into small squares. The amount was regulated by the weather. On a very bad day
few people came to church, and on a very fine one, though many came, few stayed
for communion. There were most when it was dry enough to make the walk to
church pleasant, but not so fine that people wanted to hurry away.
</p>

<p>
Then Mrs. Carey brought the communion plate out of the safe, which stood in the
pantry, and the Vicar polished it with a chamois leather. At ten the fly drove
up, and Mr. Carey got into his boots. Mrs. Carey took several minutes to put on
her bonnet, during which the Vicar, in a voluminous cloak, stood in the hall
with just such an expression on his face as would have become an early
Christian about to be led into the arena. It was extraordinary that after
thirty years of marriage his wife could not be ready in time on Sunday morning.
At last she came, in black satin; the Vicar did not like colours in a
clergyman&rsquo;s wife at any time, but on Sundays he was determined that she
should wear black; now and then, in conspiracy with Miss Graves, she ventured a
white feather or a pink rose in her bonnet, but the Vicar insisted that it
should disappear; he said he would not go to church with the scarlet woman:
Mrs. Carey sighed as a woman but obeyed as a wife. They were about to step into
the carriage when the Vicar remembered that no one had given him his egg. They
knew that he must have an egg for his voice, there were two women in the house,
and no one had the least regard for his comfort. Mrs. Carey scolded Mary Ann,
and Mary Ann answered that she could not think of everything. She hurried away
to fetch an egg, and Mrs. Carey beat it up in a glass of sherry. The Vicar
swallowed it at a gulp. The communion plate was stowed in the carriage, and
they set off.
</p>

<p>
The fly came from The Red Lion and had a peculiar smell of stale straw. They
drove with both windows closed so that the Vicar should not catch cold. The
sexton was waiting at the porch to take the communion plate, and while the
Vicar went to the vestry Mrs. Carey and Philip settled themselves in the
vicarage pew. Mrs. Carey placed in front of her the sixpenny bit she was
accustomed to put in the plate, and gave Philip threepence for the same
purpose. The church filled up gradually and the service began.
</p>

<p>
Philip grew bored during the sermon, but if he fidgetted Mrs. Carey put a
gentle hand on his arm and looked at him reproachfully. He regained interest
when the final hymn was sung and Mr. Graves passed round with the plate.
</p>

<p>
When everyone had gone Mrs. Carey went into Miss Graves&rsquo; pew to have a
few words with her while they were waiting for the gentlemen, and Philip went
to the vestry. His uncle, the curate, and Mr. Graves were still in their
surplices. Mr. Carey gave him the remains of the consecrated bread and told him
he might eat it. He had been accustomed to eat it himself, as it seemed
blasphemous to throw it away, but Philip&rsquo;s keen appetite relieved him
from the duty. Then they counted the money. It consisted of pennies, sixpences
and threepenny bits. There were always two single shillings, one put in the
plate by the Vicar and the other by Mr. Graves; and sometimes there was a
florin. Mr. Graves told the Vicar who had given this. It was always a stranger
to Blackstable, and Mr. Carey wondered who he was. But Miss Graves had observed
the rash act and was able to tell Mrs. Carey that the stranger came from
London, was married and had children. During the drive home Mrs. Carey passed
the information on, and the Vicar made up his mind to call on him and ask for a
subscription to the Additional Curates Society. Mr. Carey asked if Philip had
behaved properly; and Mrs. Carey remarked that Mrs. Wigram had a new mantle,
Mr. Cox was not in church, and somebody thought that Miss Phillips was engaged.
When they reached the vicarage they all felt that they deserved a substantial
dinner.
</p>

<p>
When this was over Mrs. Carey went to her room to rest, and Mr. Carey lay down
on the sofa in the drawing-room for forty winks.
</p>

<p>
They had tea at five, and the Vicar ate an egg to support himself for evensong.
Mrs. Carey did not go to this so that Mary Ann might, but she read the service
through and the hymns. Mr. Carey walked to church in the evening, and Philip
limped along by his side. The walk through the darkness along the country road
strangely impressed him, and the church with all its lights in the distance,
coming gradually nearer, seemed very friendly. At first he was shy with his
uncle, but little by little grew used to him, and he would slip his hand in his
uncle&rsquo;s and walk more easily for the feeling of protection.
</p>

<p>
They had supper when they got home. Mr. Carey&rsquo;s slippers were waiting for
him on a footstool in front of the fire and by their side Philip&rsquo;s, one
the shoe of a small boy, the other misshapen and odd. He was dreadfully tired
when he went up to bed, and he did not resist when Mary Ann undressed him. She
kissed him after she tucked him up, and he began to love her.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>VIII</h2>

<p>
Philip had led always the solitary life of an only child, and his loneliness at
the vicarage was no greater than it had been when his mother lived. He made
friends with Mary Ann. She was a chubby little person of thirty-five, the
daughter of a fisherman, and had come to the vicarage at eighteen; it was her
first place and she had no intention of leaving it; but she held a possible
marriage as a rod over the timid heads of her master and mistress. Her father
and mother lived in a little house off Harbour Street, and she went to see them
on her evenings out. Her stories of the sea touched Philip&rsquo;s imagination,
and the narrow alleys round the harbour grew rich with the romance which his
young fancy lent them. One evening he asked whether he might go home with her;
but his aunt was afraid that he might catch something, and his uncle said that
evil communications corrupted good manners. He disliked the fisher folk, who
were rough, uncouth, and went to chapel. But Philip was more comfortable in the
kitchen than in the dining-room, and, whenever he could, he took his toys and
played there. His aunt was not sorry. She did not like disorder, and though she
recognised that boys must be expected to be untidy she preferred that he should
make a mess in the kitchen. If he fidgeted his uncle was apt to grow restless
and say it was high time he went to school. Mrs. Carey thought Philip very
young for this, and her heart went out to the motherless child; but her
attempts to gain his affection were awkward, and the boy, feeling shy, received
her demonstrations with so much sullenness that she was mortified. Sometimes
she heard his shrill voice raised in laughter in the kitchen, but when she went
in, he grew suddenly silent, and he flushed darkly when Mary Ann explained the
joke. Mrs. Carey could not see anything amusing in what she heard, and she
smiled with constraint.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He seems happier with Mary Ann than with us, William,&rdquo; she said,
when she returned to her sewing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One can see he&rsquo;s been very badly brought up. He wants licking into
shape.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
On the second Sunday after Philip arrived an unlucky incident occurred. Mr.
Carey had retired as usual after dinner for a little snooze in the
drawing-room, but he was in an irritable mood and could not sleep. Josiah
Graves that morning had objected strongly to some candlesticks with which the
Vicar had adorned the altar. He had bought them second-hand in Tercanbury, and
he thought they looked very well. But Josiah Graves said they were popish. This
was a taunt that always aroused the Vicar. He had been at Oxford during the
movement which ended in the secession from the Established Church of Edward
Manning, and he felt a certain sympathy for the Church of Rome. He would
willingly have made the service more ornate than had been usual in the
low-church parish of Blackstable, and in his secret soul he yearned for
processions and lighted candles. He drew the line at incense. He hated the word
protestant. He called himself a Catholic. He was accustomed to say that Papists
required an epithet, they were Roman Catholic; but the Church of England was
Catholic in the best, the fullest, and the noblest sense of the term. He was
pleased to think that his shaven face gave him the look of a priest, and in his
youth he had possessed an ascetic air which added to the impression. He often
related that on one of his holidays in Boulogne, one of those holidays upon
which his wife for economy&rsquo;s sake did not accompany him, when he was
sitting in a church, the cure had come up to him and invited him to preach a
sermon. He dismissed his curates when they married, having decided views on the
celibacy of the unbeneficed clergy. But when at an election the Liberals had
written on his garden fence in large blue letters: This way to Rome, he had
been very angry, and threatened to prosecute the leaders of the Liberal party
in Blackstable. He made up his mind now that nothing Josiah Graves said would
induce him to remove the candlesticks from the altar, and he muttered Bismarck
to himself once or twice irritably.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he heard an unexpected noise. He pulled the handkerchief off his face,
got up from the sofa on which he was lying, and went into the dining-room.
Philip was seated on the table with all his bricks around him. He had built a
monstrous castle, and some defect in the foundation had just brought the
structure down in noisy ruin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you doing with those bricks, Philip? You know you&rsquo;re not
allowed to play games on Sunday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip stared at him for a moment with frightened eyes, and, as his habit was,
flushed deeply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I always used to play at home,&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure your dear mamma never allowed you to do such a wicked
thing as that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip did not know it was wicked; but if it was, he did not wish it to be
supposed that his mother had consented to it. He hung his head and did not
answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know it&rsquo;s very, very wicked to play on Sunday?
What d&rsquo;you suppose it&rsquo;s called the day of rest for? You&rsquo;re
going to church tonight, and how can you face your Maker when you&rsquo;ve been
breaking one of His laws in the afternoon?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Carey told him to put the bricks away at once, and stood over him while
Philip did so.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a very naughty boy,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Think of the
grief you&rsquo;re causing your poor mother in heaven.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip felt inclined to cry, but he had an instinctive disinclination to
letting other people see his tears, and he clenched his teeth to prevent the
sobs from escaping. Mr. Carey sat down in his arm-chair and began to turn over
the pages of a book. Philip stood at the window. The vicarage was set back from
the highroad to Tercanbury, and from the dining-room one saw a semicircular
strip of lawn and then as far as the horizon green fields. Sheep were grazing
in them. The sky was forlorn and gray. Philip felt infinitely unhappy.
</p>

<p>
Presently Mary Ann came in to lay the tea, and Aunt Louisa descended the
stairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you had a nice little nap, William?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Philip made so much noise that I
couldn&rsquo;t sleep a wink.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was not quite accurate, for he had been kept awake by his own thoughts;
and Philip, listening sullenly, reflected that he had only made a noise once,
and there was no reason why his uncle should not have slept before or after.
When Mrs. Carey asked for an explanation the Vicar narrated the facts.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t even said he was sorry,&rdquo; he finished.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Philip, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re sorry,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carey,
anxious that the child should not seem wickeder to his uncle than need be.
</p>

<p>
Philip did not reply. He went on munching his bread and butter. He did not know
what power it was in him that prevented him from making any expression of
regret. He felt his ears tingling, he was a little inclined to cry, but no word
would issue from his lips.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t make it worse by sulking,&rdquo; said Mr. Carey.
</p>

<p>
Tea was finished in silence. Mrs. Carey looked at Philip surreptitiously now
and then, but the Vicar elaborately ignored him. When Philip saw his uncle go
upstairs to get ready for church he went into the hall and got his hat and
coat, but when the Vicar came downstairs and saw him, he said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish you to go to church tonight, Philip. I don&rsquo;t
think you&rsquo;re in a proper frame of mind to enter the House of God.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip did not say a word. He felt it was a deep humiliation that was placed
upon him, and his cheeks reddened. He stood silently watching his uncle put on
his broad hat and his voluminous cloak. Mrs. Carey as usual went to the door to
see him off. Then she turned to Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind, Philip, you won&rsquo;t be a naughty boy next Sunday, will
you, and then your uncle will take you to church with him in the
evening.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She took off his hat and coat, and led him into the dining-room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall you and I read the service together, Philip, and we&rsquo;ll sing
the hymns at the harmonium. Would you like that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip shook his head decidedly. Mrs. Carey was taken aback. If he would not
read the evening service with her she did not know what to do with him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then what would you like to do until your uncle comes back?&rdquo; she
asked helplessly.
</p>

<p>
Philip broke his silence at last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want to be left alone,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Philip, how can you say anything so unkind? Don&rsquo;t you know that
your uncle and I only want your good? Don&rsquo;t you love me at all?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hate you. I wish you was dead.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Carey gasped. He said the words so savagely that it gave her quite a
start. She had nothing to say. She sat down in her husband&rsquo;s chair; and
as she thought of her desire to love the friendless, crippled boy and her eager
wish that he should love her&mdash;she was a barren woman and, even though it
was clearly God&rsquo;s will that she should be childless, she could scarcely
bear to look at little children sometimes, her heart ached so&mdash;the tears
rose to her eyes and one by one, slowly, rolled down her cheeks. Philip watched
her in amazement. She took out her handkerchief, and now she cried without
restraint. Suddenly Philip realised that she was crying because of what he had
said, and he was sorry. He went up to her silently and kissed her. It was the
first kiss he had ever given her without being asked. And the poor lady, so
small in her black satin, shrivelled up and sallow, with her funny corkscrew
curls, took the little boy on her lap and put her arms around him and wept as
though her heart would break. But her tears were partly tears of happiness, for
she felt that the strangeness between them was gone. She loved him now with a
new love because he had made her suffer.

<h2>IX</h2>

<p>
On the following Sunday, when the Vicar was making his preparations to go into
the drawing-room for his nap&mdash;all the actions of his life were conducted
with ceremony&mdash;and Mrs. Carey was about to go upstairs, Philip asked:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What shall I do if I&rsquo;m not allowed to play?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you sit still for once and be quiet?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sit still till tea-time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Carey looked out of the window, but it was cold and raw, and he could not
suggest that Philip should go into the garden.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know what you can do. You can learn by heart the collect for the
day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He took the prayer-book which was used for prayers from the harmonium, and
turned the pages till he came to the place he wanted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a long one. If you can say it without a mistake when I
come in to tea you shall have the top of my egg.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Carey drew up Philip&rsquo;s chair to the dining-room table&mdash;they had
bought him a high chair by now&mdash;and placed the book in front of him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The devil finds work for idle hands to do,&rdquo; said Mr. Carey.
</p>

<p>
He put some more coals on the fire so that there should be a cheerful blaze
when he came in to tea, and went into the drawing-room. He loosened his collar,
arranged the cushions, and settled himself comfortably on the sofa. But
thinking the drawing-room a little chilly, Mrs. Carey brought him a rug from
the hall; she put it over his legs and tucked it round his feet. She drew the
blinds so that the light should not offend his eyes, and since he had closed
them already went out of the room on tiptoe. The Vicar was at peace with
himself today, and in ten minutes he was asleep. He snored softly.
</p>

<p>
It was the Sixth Sunday after Epiphany, and the collect began with the words: O
God, whose blessed Son was manifested that he might destroy the works of the
devil, and make us the sons of God, and heirs of Eternal life. Philip read it
through. He could make no sense of it. He began saying the words aloud to
himself, but many of them were unknown to him, and the construction of the
sentence was strange. He could not get more than two lines in his head. And his
attention was constantly wandering: there were fruit trees trained on the walls
of the vicarage, and a long twig beat now and then against the windowpane;
sheep grazed stolidly in the field beyond the garden. It seemed as though there
were knots inside his brain. Then panic seized him that he would not know the
words by tea-time, and he kept on whispering them to himself quickly; he did
not try to understand, but merely to get them parrot-like into his memory.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Carey could not sleep that afternoon, and by four o&rsquo;clock she was so
wide awake that she came downstairs. She thought she would hear Philip his
collect so that he should make no mistakes when he said it to his uncle. His
uncle then would be pleased; he would see that the boy&rsquo;s heart was in the
right place. But when Mrs. Carey came to the dining-room and was about to go
in, she heard a sound that made her stop suddenly. Her heart gave a little
jump. She turned away and quietly slipped out of the front-door. She walked
round the house till she came to the dining-room window and then cautiously
looked in. Philip was still sitting on the chair she had put him in, but his
head was on the table buried in his arms, and he was sobbing desperately. She
saw the convulsive movement of his shoulders. Mrs. Carey was frightened. A
thing that had always struck her about the child was that he seemed so
collected. She had never seen him cry. And now she realised that his calmness
was some instinctive shame of showing his feelings: he hid himself to weep.
</p>

<p>
Without thinking that her husband disliked being wakened suddenly, she burst
into the drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;William, William,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The boy&rsquo;s crying as
though his heart would break.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Carey sat up and disentangled himself from the rug about his legs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he got to cry about?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know…. Oh, William, we can&rsquo;t let the boy be unhappy.
D&rsquo;you think it&rsquo;s our fault? If we&rsquo;d had children we&rsquo;d
have known what to do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Carey looked at her in perplexity. He felt extraordinarily helpless.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t be crying because I gave him the collect to learn.
It&rsquo;s not more than ten lines.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I might take him some picture books to look at,
William? There are some of the Holy Land. There couldn&rsquo;t be anything
wrong in that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well, I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Carey went into the study. To collect books was Mr. Carey&rsquo;s only
passion, and he never went into Tercanbury without spending an hour or two in
the second-hand shop; he always brought back four or five musty volumes. He
never read them, for he had long lost the habit of reading, but he liked to
turn the pages, look at the illustrations if they were illustrated, and mend
the bindings. He welcomed wet days because on them he could stay at home
without pangs of conscience and spend the afternoon with white of egg and a
glue-pot, patching up the Russia leather of some battered quarto. He had many
volumes of old travels, with steel engravings, and Mrs. Carey quickly found two
which described Palestine. She coughed elaborately at the door so that Philip
should have time to compose himself, she felt that he would be humiliated if
she came upon him in the midst of his tears, then she rattled the door handle.
When she went in Philip was poring over the prayer-book, hiding his eyes with
his hands so that she might not see he had been crying.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know the collect yet?&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
He did not answer for a moment, and she felt that he did not trust his voice.
She was oddly embarrassed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t learn it by heart,&rdquo; he said at last, with a gasp.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, well, never mind,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t.
I&rsquo;ve got some picture books for you to look at. Come and sit on my lap,
and we&rsquo;ll look at them together.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip slipped off his chair and limped over to her. He looked down so that she
should not see his eyes. She put her arms round him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the place where our blessed
Lord was born.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She showed him an Eastern town with flat roofs and cupolas and minarets. In the
foreground was a group of palm-trees, and under them were resting two Arabs and
some camels. Philip passed his hand over the picture as if he wanted to feel
the houses and the loose habiliments of the nomads.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Read what it says,&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Carey in her even voice read the opposite page. It was a romantic
narrative of some Eastern traveller of the thirties, pompous maybe, but
fragrant with the emotion with which the East came to the generation that
followed Byron and Chateaubriand. In a moment or two Philip interrupted her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want to see another picture.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When Mary Ann came in and Mrs. Carey rose to help her lay the cloth. Philip
took the book in his hands and hurried through the illustrations. It was with
difficulty that his aunt induced him to put the book down for tea. He had
forgotten his horrible struggle to get the collect by heart; he had forgotten
his tears. Next day it was raining, and he asked for the book again. Mrs. Carey
gave it him joyfully. Talking over his future with her husband she had found
that both desired him to take orders, and this eagerness for the book which
described places hallowed by the presence of Jesus seemed a good sign. It
looked as though the boy&rsquo;s mind addressed itself naturally to holy
things. But in a day or two he asked for more books. Mr. Carey took him into
his study, showed him the shelf in which he kept illustrated works, and chose
for him one that dealt with Rome. Philip took it greedily. The pictures led him
to a new amusement. He began to read the page before and the page after each
engraving to find out what it was about, and soon he lost all interest in his
toys.
</p>

<p>
Then, when no one was near, he took out books for himself; and perhaps because
the first impression on his mind was made by an Eastern town, he found his
chief amusement in those which described the Levant. His heart beat with
excitement at the pictures of mosques and rich palaces; but there was one, in a
book on Constantinople, which peculiarly stirred his imagination. It was called
the Hall of the Thousand Columns. It was a Byzantine cistern, which the popular
fancy had endowed with fantastic vastness; and the legend which he read told
that a boat was always moored at the entrance to tempt the unwary, but no
traveller venturing into the darkness had ever been seen again. And Philip
wondered whether the boat went on for ever through one pillared alley after
another or came at last to some strange mansion.
</p>

<p>
One day a good fortune befell him, for he hit upon Lane&rsquo;s translation of
The Thousand Nights and a Night. He was captured first by the illustrations,
and then he began to read, to start with, the stories that dealt with magic,
and then the others; and those he liked he read again and again. He could think
of nothing else. He forgot the life about him. He had to be called two or three
times before he would come to his dinner. Insensibly he formed the most
delightful habit in the world, the habit of reading: he did not know that thus
he was providing himself with a refuge from all the distress of life; he did
not know either that he was creating for himself an unreal world which would
make the real world of every day a source of bitter disappointment. Presently
he began to read other things. His brain was precocious. His uncle and aunt,
seeing that he occupied himself and neither worried nor made a noise, ceased to
trouble themselves about him. Mr. Carey had so many books that he did not know
them, and as he read little he forgot the odd lots he had bought at one time
and another because they were cheap. Haphazard among the sermons and homilies,
the travels, the lives of the Saints, the Fathers, the histories of the church,
were old-fashioned novels; and these Philip at last discovered. He chose them
by their titles, and the first he read was The Lancashire Witches, and then he
read The Admirable Crichton, and then many more. Whenever he started a book
with two solitary travellers riding along the brink of a desperate ravine he
knew he was safe.
</p>

<p>
The summer was come now, and the gardener, an old sailor, made him a hammock
and fixed it up for him in the branches of a weeping willow. And here for long
hours he lay, hidden from anyone who might come to the vicarage, reading,
reading passionately. Time passed and it was July; August came: on Sundays the
church was crowded with strangers, and the collection at the offertory often
amounted to two pounds. Neither the Vicar nor Mrs. Carey went out of the garden
much during this period; for they disliked strange faces, and they looked upon
the visitors from London with aversion. The house opposite was taken for six
weeks by a gentleman who had two little boys, and he sent in to ask if Philip
would like to go and play with them; but Mrs. Carey returned a polite refusal.
She was afraid that Philip would be corrupted by little boys from London. He
was going to be a clergyman, and it was necessary that he should be preserved
from contamination. She liked to see in him an infant Samuel.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>X</h2>

<p>
The Careys made up their minds to send Philip to King&rsquo;s School at
Tercanbury. The neighbouring clergy sent their sons there. It was united by
long tradition to the Cathedral: its headmaster was an honorary Canon, and a
past headmaster was the Archdeacon. Boys were encouraged there to aspire to
Holy Orders, and the education was such as might prepare an honest lad to spend
his life in God&rsquo;s service. A preparatory school was attached to it, and
to this it was arranged that Philip should go. Mr. Carey took him into
Tercanbury one Thursday afternoon towards the end of September. All day Philip
had been excited and rather frightened. He knew little of school life but what
he had read in the stories of The Boy&rsquo;s Own Paper. He had also read Eric,
or Little by Little.
</p>

<p>
When they got out of the train at Tercanbury, Philip felt sick with
apprehension, and during the drive in to the town sat pale and silent. The high
brick wall in front of the school gave it the look of a prison. There was a
little door in it, which opened on their ringing; and a clumsy, untidy man came
out and fetched Philip&rsquo;s tin trunk and his play-box. They were shown into
the drawing-room; it was filled with massive, ugly furniture, and the chairs of
the suite were placed round the walls with a forbidding rigidity. They waited
for the headmaster.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s Mr. Watson like?&rdquo; asked Philip, after a while.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see for yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was another pause. Mr. Carey wondered why the headmaster did not come.
Presently Philip made an effort and spoke again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell him I&rsquo;ve got a club-foot,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
Before Mr. Carey could speak the door burst open and Mr. Watson swept into the
room. To Philip he seemed gigantic. He was a man of over six feet high, and
broad, with enormous hands and a great red beard; he talked loudly in a jovial
manner; but his aggressive cheerfulness struck terror in Philip&rsquo;s heart.
He shook hands with Mr. Carey, and then took Philip&rsquo;s small hand in his.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, young fellow, are you glad to come to school?&rdquo; he shouted.
</p>

<p>
Philip reddened and found no word to answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nine,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must say sir,&rdquo; said his uncle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I expect you&rsquo;ve got a good lot to learn,&rdquo; the headmaster
bellowed cheerily.
</p>

<p>
To give the boy confidence he began to tickle him with rough fingers. Philip,
feeling shy and uncomfortable, squirmed under his touch.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve put him in the small dormitory for the present…. You&rsquo;ll
like that, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he added to Philip. &ldquo;Only eight of you
in there. You won&rsquo;t feel so strange.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then the door opened, and Mrs. Watson came in. She was a dark woman with black
hair, neatly parted in the middle. She had curiously thick lips and a small
round nose. Her eyes were large and black. There was a singular coldness in her
appearance. She seldom spoke and smiled more seldom still. Her husband
introduced Mr. Carey to her, and then gave Philip a friendly push towards her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is a new boy, Helen, His name&rsquo;s Carey.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Without a word she shook hands with Philip and then sat down, not speaking,
while the headmaster asked Mr. Carey how much Philip knew and what books he had
been working with. The Vicar of Blackstable was a little embarrassed by Mr.
Watson&rsquo;s boisterous heartiness, and in a moment or two got up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d better leave Philip with you now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Mr. Watson. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be
safe with me. He&rsquo;ll get on like a house on fire. Won&rsquo;t you, young
fellow?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Without waiting for an answer from Philip the big man burst into a great bellow
of laughter. Mr. Carey kissed Philip on the forehead and went away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come along, young fellow,&rdquo; shouted Mr. Watson. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
show you the school-room.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He swept out of the drawing-room with giant strides, and Philip hurriedly
limped behind him. He was taken into a long, bare room with two tables that ran
along its whole length; on each side of them were wooden forms.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nobody much here yet,&rdquo; said Mr. Watson. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just
show you the playground, and then I&rsquo;ll leave you to shift for
yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Watson led the way. Philip found himself in a large play-ground with high
brick walls on three sides of it. On the fourth side was an iron railing
through which you saw a vast lawn and beyond this some of the buildings of
King&rsquo;s School. One small boy was wandering disconsolately, kicking up the
gravel as he walked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hulloa, Venning,&rdquo; shouted Mr. Watson. &ldquo;When did you turn
up?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The small boy came forward and shook hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a new boy. He&rsquo;s older and bigger than you, so
don&rsquo;t you bully him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The headmaster glared amicably at the two children, filling them with fear by
the roar of his voice, and then with a guffaw left them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Carey.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your father?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! Does your mother wash?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My mother&rsquo;s dead, too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip thought this answer would cause the boy a certain awkwardness, but
Venning was not to be turned from his facetiousness for so little.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, did she wash?&rdquo; he went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Philip indignantly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She was a washerwoman then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, she wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then she didn&rsquo;t wash.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The little boy crowed with delight at the success of his dialectic. Then he
caught sight of Philip&rsquo;s feet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with your foot?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip instinctively tried to withdraw it from sight. He hid it behind the one
which was whole.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a club-foot,&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How did you get it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always had it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The little boy accompanied the words with a sharp kick on Philip&rsquo;s shin,
which Philip did not expect and thus could not guard against. The pain was so
great that it made him gasp, but greater than the pain was the surprise. He did
not know why Venning kicked him. He had not the presence of mind to give him a
black eye. Besides, the boy was smaller than he, and he had read in The
Boy&rsquo;s Own Paper that it was a mean thing to hit anyone smaller than
yourself. While Philip was nursing his shin a third boy appeared, and his
tormentor left him. In a little while he noticed that the pair were talking
about him, and he felt they were looking at his feet. He grew hot and
uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
But others arrived, a dozen together, and then more, and they began to talk
about their doings during the holidays, where they had been, and what wonderful
cricket they had played. A few new boys appeared, and with these presently
Philip found himself talking. He was shy and nervous. He was anxious to make
himself pleasant, but he could not think of anything to say. He was asked a
great many questions and answered them all quite willingly. One boy asked him
whether he could play cricket.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Philip. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a club-foot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The boy looked down quickly and reddened. Philip saw that he felt he had asked
an unseemly question. He was too shy to apologise and looked at Philip
awkwardly.

<h2>XI</h2>

<p>
Next morning when the clanging of a bell awoke Philip he looked round his
cubicle in astonishment. Then a voice sang out, and he remembered where he was.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you awake, Singer?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The partitions of the cubicle were of polished pitch-pine, and there was a
green curtain in front. In those days there was little thought of ventilation,
and the windows were closed except when the dormitory was aired in the morning.
</p>

<p>
Philip got up and knelt down to say his prayers. It was a cold morning, and he
shivered a little; but he had been taught by his uncle that his prayers were
more acceptable to God if he said them in his nightshirt than if he waited till
he was dressed. This did not surprise him, for he was beginning to realise that
he was the creature of a God who appreciated the discomfort of his worshippers.
Then he washed. There were two baths for the fifty boarders, and each boy had a
bath once a week. The rest of his washing was done in a small basin on a
wash-stand, which with the bed and a chair, made up the furniture of each
cubicle. The boys chatted gaily while they dressed. Philip was all ears. Then
another bell sounded, and they ran downstairs. They took their seats on the
forms on each side of the two long tables in the school-room; and Mr. Watson,
followed by his wife and the servants, came in and sat down. Mr. Watson read
prayers in an impressive manner, and the supplications thundered out in his
loud voice as though they were threats personally addressed to each boy. Philip
listened with anxiety. Then Mr. Watson read a chapter from the Bible, and the
servants trooped out. In a moment the untidy youth brought in two large pots of
tea and on a second journey immense dishes of bread and butter.
</p>

<p>
Philip had a squeamish appetite, and the thick slabs of poor butter on the
bread turned his stomach, but he saw other boys scraping it off and followed
their example. They all had potted meats and such like, which they had brought
in their play-boxes; and some had &lsquo;extras,&rsquo; eggs or bacon, upon
which Mr. Watson made a profit. When he had asked Mr. Carey whether Philip was
to have these, Mr. Carey replied that he did not think boys should be spoilt.
Mr. Watson quite agreed with him&mdash;he considered nothing was better than
bread and butter for growing lads&mdash;but some parents, unduly pampering
their offspring, insisted on it.
</p>

<p>
Philip noticed that &lsquo;extras&rsquo; gave boys a certain consideration and
made up his mind, when he wrote to Aunt Louisa, to ask for them.
</p>

<p>
After breakfast the boys wandered out into the play-ground. Here the day-boys
were gradually assembling. They were sons of the local clergy, of the officers
at the Depot, and of such manufacturers or men of business as the old town
possessed. Presently a bell rang, and they all trooped into school. This
consisted of a large, long room at opposite ends of which two under-masters
conducted the second and third forms, and of a smaller one, leading out of it,
used by Mr. Watson, who taught the first form. To attach the preparatory to the
senior school these three classes were known officially, on speech days and in
reports, as upper, middle, and lower second. Philip was put in the last. The
master, a red-faced man with a pleasant voice, was called Rice; he had a jolly
manner with boys, and the time passed quickly. Philip was surprised when it was
a quarter to eleven and they were let out for ten minutes&rsquo; rest.
</p>

<p>
The whole school rushed noisily into the play-ground. The new boys were told to
go into the middle, while the others stationed themselves along opposite walls.
They began to play Pig in the Middle. The old boys ran from wall to wall while
the new boys tried to catch them: when one was seized and the mystic words
said&mdash;one, two, three, and a pig for me&mdash;he became a prisoner and,
turning sides, helped to catch those who were still free. Philip saw a boy
running past and tried to catch him, but his limp gave him no chance; and the
runners, taking their opportunity, made straight for the ground he covered.
Then one of them had the brilliant idea of imitating Philip&rsquo;s clumsy run.
Other boys saw it and began to laugh; then they all copied the first; and they
ran round Philip, limping grotesquely, screaming in their treble voices with
shrill laughter. They lost their heads with the delight of their new amusement,
and choked with helpless merriment. One of them tripped Philip up and he fell,
heavily as he always fell, and cut his knee. They laughed all the louder when
he got up. A boy pushed him from behind, and he would have fallen again if
another had not caught him. The game was forgotten in the entertainment of
Philip&rsquo;s deformity. One of them invented an odd, rolling limp that struck
the rest as supremely ridiculous, and several of the boys lay down on the
ground and rolled about in laughter: Philip was completely scared. He could not
make out why they were laughing at him. His heart beat so that he could hardly
breathe, and he was more frightened than he had ever been in his life. He stood
still stupidly while the boys ran round him, mimicking and laughing; they
shouted to him to try and catch them; but he did not move. He did not want them
to see him run any more. He was using all his strength to prevent himself from
crying.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the bell rang, and they all trooped back to school. Philip&rsquo;s
knee was bleeding, and he was dusty and dishevelled. For some minutes Mr. Rice
could not control his form. They were excited still by the strange novelty, and
Philip saw one or two of them furtively looking down at his feet. He tucked
them under the bench.
</p>

<p>
In the afternoon they went up to play football, but Mr. Watson stopped Philip
on the way out after dinner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you can&rsquo;t play football, Carey?&rdquo; he asked him.
</p>

<p>
Philip blushed self-consciously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well. You&rsquo;d better go up to the field. You can walk as far as
that, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip had no idea where the field was, but he answered all the same.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The boys went in charge of Mr. Rice, who glanced at Philip and seeing he had
not changed, asked why he was not going to play.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Watson said I needn&rsquo;t, sir,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There were boys all round him, looking at him curiously, and a feeling of shame
came over Philip. He looked down without answering. Others gave the reply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a club-foot, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Rice was quite young; he had only taken his degree a year before; and he
was suddenly embarrassed. His instinct was to beg the boy&rsquo;s pardon, but
he was too shy to do so. He made his voice gruff and loud.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now then, you boys, what are you waiting about for? Get on with
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Some of them had already started and those that were left now set off, in
groups of two or three.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better come along with me, Carey,&rdquo; said the master
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the way, do you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip guessed the kindness, and a sob came to his throat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go very fast, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go very slow,&rdquo; said the master, with a smile.
</p>

<p>
Philip&rsquo;s heart went out to the red-faced, commonplace young man who said
a gentle word to him. He suddenly felt less unhappy.
</p>

<p>
But at night when they went up to bed and were undressing, the boy who was
called Singer came out of his cubicle and put his head in Philip&rsquo;s.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, let&rsquo;s look at your foot,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Philip.
</p>

<p>
He jumped into bed quickly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say no to me,&rdquo; said Singer. &ldquo;Come on,
Mason.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The boy in the next cubicle was looking round the corner, and at the words he
slipped in. They made for Philip and tried to tear the bed-clothes off him, but
he held them tightly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you leave me alone?&rdquo; he cried.
</p>

<p>
Singer seized a brush and with the back of it beat Philip&rsquo;s hands
clenched on the blanket. Philip cried out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you show us your foot quietly?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In desperation Philip clenched his fist and hit the boy who tormented him, but
he was at a disadvantage, and the boy seized his arm. He began to turn it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
break my arm.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop still then and put out your foot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip gave a sob and a gasp. The boy gave the arm another wrench. The pain was
unendurable.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
He put out his foot. Singer still kept his hand on Philip&rsquo;s wrist. He
looked curiously at the deformity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it beastly?&rdquo; said Mason.
</p>

<p>
Another came in and looked too.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ugh,&rdquo; he said, in disgust.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My word, it is rum,&rdquo; said Singer, making a face. &ldquo;Is it
hard?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He touched it with the tip of his forefinger, cautiously, as though it were
something that had a life of its own. Suddenly they heard Mr. Watson&rsquo;s
heavy tread on the stairs. They threw the clothes back on Philip and dashed
like rabbits into their cubicles. Mr. Watson came into the dormitory. Raising
himself on tiptoe he could see over the rod that bore the green curtain, and he
looked into two or three of the cubicles. The little boys were safely in bed.
He put out the light and went out.
</p>

<p>
Singer called out to Philip, but he did not answer. He had got his teeth in the
pillow so that his sobbing should be inaudible. He was not crying for the pain
they had caused him, nor for the humiliation he had suffered when they looked
at his foot, but with rage at himself because, unable to stand the torture, he
had put out his foot of his own accord.
</p>

<p>
And then he felt the misery of his life. It seemed to his childish mind that
this unhappiness must go on for ever. For no particular reason he remembered
that cold morning when Emma had taken him out of bed and put him beside his
mother. He had not thought of it once since it happened, but now he seemed to
feel the warmth of his mother&rsquo;s body against his and her arms around him.
Suddenly it seemed to him that his life was a dream, his mother&rsquo;s death,
and the life at the vicarage, and these two wretched days at school, and he
would awake in the morning and be back again at home. His tears dried as he
thought of it. He was too unhappy, it must be nothing but a dream, and his
mother was alive, and Emma would come up presently and go to bed. He fell
asleep.
</p>

<p>
But when he awoke next morning it was to the clanging of a bell, and the first
thing his eyes saw was the green curtain of his cubicle.
</p>

<h2>XII</h2>

<p>
As time went on Philip&rsquo;s deformity ceased to interest. It was accepted
like one boy&rsquo;s red hair and another&rsquo;s unreasonable corpulence. But
meanwhile he had grown horribly sensitive. He never ran if he could help it,
because he knew it made his limp more conspicuous, and he adopted a peculiar
walk. He stood still as much as he could, with his club-foot behind the other,
so that it should not attract notice, and he was constantly on the look out for
any reference to it. Because he could not join in the games which other boys
played, their life remained strange to him; he only interested himself from the
outside in their doings; and it seemed to him that there was a barrier between
them and him. Sometimes they seemed to think that it was his fault if he could
not play football, and he was unable to make them understand. He was left a
good deal to himself. He had been inclined to talkativeness, but gradually he
became silent. He began to think of the difference between himself and others.
</p>

<p>
The biggest boy in his dormitory, Singer, took a dislike to him, and Philip,
small for his age, had to put up with a good deal of hard treatment. About
half-way through the term a mania ran through the school for a game called
Nibs. It was a game for two, played on a table or a form with steel pens. You
had to push your nib with the finger-nail so as to get the point of it over
your opponent&rsquo;s, while he manoeuvred to prevent this and to get the point
of his nib over the back of yours; when this result was achieved you breathed
on the ball of your thumb, pressed it hard on the two nibs, and if you were
able then to lift them without dropping either, both nibs became yours. Soon
nothing was seen but boys playing this game, and the more skilful acquired vast
stores of nibs. But in a little while Mr. Watson made up his mind that it was a
form of gambling, forbade the game, and confiscated all the nibs in the
boys&rsquo; possession. Philip had been very adroit, and it was with a heavy
heart that he gave up his winning; but his fingers itched to play still, and a
few days later, on his way to the football field, he went into a shop and
bought a pennyworth of J pens. He carried them loose in his pocket and enjoyed
feeling them. Presently Singer found out that he had them. Singer had given up
his nibs too, but he had kept back a very large one, called a Jumbo, which was
almost unconquerable, and he could not resist the opportunity of getting
Philip&rsquo;s Js out of him. Though Philip knew that he was at a disadvantage
with his small nibs, he had an adventurous disposition and was willing to take
the risk; besides, he was aware that Singer would not allow him to refuse. He
had not played for a week and sat down to the game now with a thrill of
excitement. He lost two of his small nibs quickly, and Singer was jubilant, but
the third time by some chance the Jumbo slipped round and Philip was able to
push his J across it. He crowed with triumph. At that moment Mr. Watson came
in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
He looked from Singer to Philip, but neither answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that I&rsquo;ve forbidden you to play that idiotic
game?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip&rsquo;s heart beat fast. He knew what was coming and was dreadfully
frightened, but in his fright there was a certain exultation. He had never been
swished. Of course it would hurt, but it was something to boast about
afterwards.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come into my study.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The headmaster turned, and they followed him side by side Singer whispered to
Philip:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in for it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Watson pointed to Singer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bend over,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
Philip, very white, saw the boy quiver at each stroke, and after the third he
heard him cry out. Three more followed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do. Get up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Singer stood up. The tears were streaming down his face. Philip stepped
forward. Mr. Watson looked at him for a moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to cane you. You&rsquo;re a new boy. And I
can&rsquo;t hit a cripple. Go away, both of you, and don&rsquo;t be naughty
again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When they got back into the school-room a group of boys, who had learned in
some mysterious way what was happening, were waiting for them. They set upon
Singer at once with eager questions. Singer faced them, his face red with the
pain and marks of tears still on his cheeks. He pointed with his head at
Philip, who was standing a little behind him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He got off because he&rsquo;s a cripple,&rdquo; he said angrily.
</p>

<p>
Philip stood silent and flushed. He felt that they looked at him with contempt.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How many did you get?&rdquo; one boy asked Singer.
</p>

<p>
But he did not answer. He was angry because he had been hurt
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me to play Nibs with you again,&rdquo; he said to
Philip. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s jolly nice for you. You don&rsquo;t risk
anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He quickly put out his foot and tripped Philip up. Philip was always rather
unsteady on his feet, and he fell heavily to the ground.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Cripple,&rdquo; said Singer.
</p>

<p>
For the rest of the term he tormented Philip cruelly, and, though Philip tried
to keep out of his way, the school was so small that it was impossible; he
tried being friendly and jolly with him; he abased himself, so far as to buy
him a knife; but though Singer took the knife he was not placated. Once or
twice, driven beyond endurance, he hit and kicked the bigger boy, but Singer
was so much stronger that Philip was helpless, and he was always forced after
more or less torture to beg his pardon. It was that which rankled with Philip:
he could not bear the humiliation of apologies, which were wrung from him by
pain greater than he could bear. And what made it worse was that there seemed
no end to his wretchedness; Singer was only eleven and would not go to the
upper school till he was thirteen. Philip realised that he must live two years
with a tormentor from whom there was no escape. He was only happy while he was
working and when he got into bed. And often there recurred to him then that
queer feeling that his life with all its misery was nothing but a dream, and
that he would awake in the morning in his own little bed in London.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">

<h2>XIII</h2>

<p>
Two years passed, and Philip was nearly twelve. He was in the first form,
within two or three places of the top, and after Christmas when several boys
would be leaving for the senior school he would be head boy. He had already
quite a collection of prizes, worthless books on bad paper, but in gorgeous
bindings decorated with the arms of the school: his position had freed him from
bullying, and he was not unhappy. His fellows forgave him his success because
of his deformity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;After all, it&rsquo;s jolly easy for him to get prizes,&rdquo; they
said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing he CAN do but swat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had lost his early terror of Mr. Watson. He had grown used to the loud
voice, and when the headmaster&rsquo;s heavy hand was laid on his shoulder
Philip discerned vaguely the intention of a caress. He had the good memory
which is more useful for scholastic achievements than mental power, and he knew
Mr. Watson expected him to leave the preparatory school with a scholarship.
</p>

<p>
But he had grown very self-conscious. The new-born child does not realise that
his body is more a part of himself than surrounding objects, and will play with
his toes without any feeling that they belong to him more than the rattle by
his side; and it is only by degrees, through pain, that he understands the fact
of the body. And experiences of the same kind are necessary for the individual
to become conscious of himself; but here there is the difference that, although
everyone becomes equally conscious of his body as a separate and complete
organism, everyone does not become equally conscious of himself as a complete
and separate personality. The feeling of apartness from others comes to most
with puberty, but it is not always developed to such a degree as to make the
difference between the individual and his fellows noticeable to the individual.
It is such as he, as little conscious of himself as the bee in a hive, who are
the lucky in life, for they have the best chance of happiness: their activities
are shared by all, and their pleasures are only pleasures because they are
enjoyed in common; you will see them on Whit-Monday dancing on Hampstead Heath,
shouting at a football match, or from club windows in Pall Mall cheering a
royal procession. It is because of them that man has been called a social
animal.
</p>

<p>
Philip passed from the innocence of childhood to bitter consciousness of
himself by the ridicule which his club-foot had excited. The circumstances of
his case were so peculiar that he could not apply to them the ready-made rules
which acted well enough in ordinary affairs, and he was forced to think for
himself. The many books he had read filled his mind with ideas which, because
he only half understood them, gave more scope to his imagination. Beneath his
painful shyness something was growing up within him, and obscurely he realised
his personality. But at times it gave him odd surprises; he did things, he knew
not why, and afterwards when he thought of them found himself all at sea.
</p>

<p>
There was a boy called Luard between whom and Philip a friendship had arisen,
and one day, when they were playing together in the school-room, Luard began to
perform some trick with an ebony pen-holder of Philip&rsquo;s.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play the giddy ox,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
only break it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But no sooner were the words out of the boy&rsquo;s mouth than the pen-holder
snapped in two. Luard looked at Philip with dismay.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I say, I&rsquo;m awfully sorry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The tears rolled down Philip&rsquo;s cheeks, but he did not answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said Luard, with surprise.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you another one exactly the same.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about the pen-holder I care,&rdquo; said Philip, in a
trembling voice, &ldquo;only it was given me by my mater, just before she
died.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, Carey.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. It wasn&rsquo;t your fault.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip took the two pieces of the pen-holder and looked at them. He tried to
restrain his sobs. He felt utterly miserable. And yet he could not tell why,
for he knew quite well that he had bought the pen-holder during his last
holidays at Blackstable for one and twopence. He did not know in the least what
had made him invent that pathetic story, but he was quite as unhappy as though
it had been true. The pious atmosphere of the vicarage and the religious tone
of the school had made Philip&rsquo;s conscience very sensitive; he absorbed
insensibly the feeling about him that the Tempter was ever on the watch to gain
his immortal soul; and though he was not more truthful than most boys he never
told a lie without suffering from remorse. When he thought over this incident
he was very much distressed, and made up his mind that he must go to Luard and
tell him that the story was an invention. Though he dreaded humiliation more
than anything in the world, he hugged himself for two or three days at the
thought of the agonising joy of humiliating himself to the Glory of God. But he
never got any further. He satisfied his conscience by the more comfortable
method of expressing his repentance only to the Almighty. But he could not
understand why he should have been so genuinely affected by the story he was
making up. The tears that flowed down his grubby cheeks were real tears. Then
by some accident of association there occurred to him that scene when Emma had
told him of his mother&rsquo;s death, and, though he could not speak for
crying, he had insisted on going in to say good-bye to the Misses Watkin so
that they might see his grief and pity him.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>XIV</h2>

<p>
Then a wave of religiosity passed through the school. Bad language was no
longer heard, and the little nastinesses of small boys were looked upon with
hostility; the bigger boys, like the lords temporal of the Middle Ages, used
the strength of their arms to persuade those weaker than themselves to virtuous
courses.
</p>

<p>
Philip, his restless mind avid for new things, became very devout. He heard
soon that it was possible to join a Bible League, and wrote to London for
particulars. These consisted in a form to be filled up with the
applicant&rsquo;s name, age, and school; a solemn declaration to be signed that
he would read a set portion of Holy Scripture every night for a year; and a
request for half a crown; this, it was explained, was demanded partly to prove
the earnestness of the applicant&rsquo;s desire to become a member of the
League, and partly to cover clerical expenses. Philip duly sent the papers and
the money, and in return received a calendar worth about a penny, on which was
set down the appointed passage to be read each day, and a sheet of paper on one
side of which was a picture of the Good Shepherd and a lamb, and on the other,
decoratively framed in red lines, a short prayer which had to be said before
beginning to read.
</p>

<p>
Every evening he undressed as quickly as possible in order to have time for his
task before the gas was put out. He read industriously, as he read always,
without criticism, stories of cruelty, deceit, ingratitude, dishonesty, and low
cunning. Actions which would have excited his horror in the life about him, in
the reading passed through his mind without comment, because they were
committed under the direct inspiration of God. The method of the League was to
alternate a book of the Old Testament with a book of the New, and one night
Philip came across these words of Jesus Christ:
</p>

<p>
If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the
fig-tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be
thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.
</p>

<p>
And all this, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.
</p>

<p>
They made no particular impression on him, but it happened that two or three
days later, being Sunday, the Canon in residence chose them for the text of his
sermon. Even if Philip had wanted to hear this it would have been impossible,
for the boys of King&rsquo;s School sit in the choir, and the pulpit stands at
the corner of the transept so that the preacher&rsquo;s back is almost turned
to them. The distance also is so great that it needs a man with a fine voice
and a knowledge of elocution to make himself heard in the choir; and according
to long usage the Canons of Tercanbury are chosen for their learning rather
than for any qualities which might be of use in a cathedral church. But the
words of the text, perhaps because he had read them so short a while before,
came clearly enough to Philip&rsquo;s ears, and they seemed on a sudden to have
a personal application. He thought about them through most of the sermon, and
that night, on getting into bed, he turned over the pages of the Gospel and
found once more the passage. Though he believed implicitly everything he saw in
print, he had learned already that in the Bible things that said one thing
quite clearly often mysteriously meant another. There was no one he liked to
ask at school, so he kept the question he had in mind till the Christmas
holidays, and then one day he made an opportunity. It was after supper and
prayers were just finished. Mrs. Carey was counting the eggs that Mary Ann had
brought in as usual and writing on each one the date. Philip stood at the table
and pretended to turn listlessly the pages of the Bible.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, Uncle William, this passage here, does it really mean
that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He put his finger against it as though he had come across it accidentally.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Carey looked up over his spectacles. He was holding The Blackstable Times
in front of the fire. It had come in that evening damp from the press, and the
Vicar always aired it for ten minutes before he began to read.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What passage is that?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, this about if you have faith you can remove mountains.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If it says so in the Bible it is so, Philip,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carey
gently, taking up the plate-basket.
</p>

<p>
Philip looked at his uncle for an answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a matter of faith.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you mean to say that if you really believed you could move
mountains you could?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By the grace of God,&rdquo; said the Vicar.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, say good-night to your uncle, Philip,&rdquo; said Aunt Louisa.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not wanting to move a mountain tonight, are you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip allowed himself to be kissed on the forehead by his uncle and preceded
Mrs. Carey upstairs. He had got the information he wanted. His little room was
icy, and he shivered when he put on his nightshirt. But he always felt that his
prayers were more pleasing to God when he said them under conditions of
discomfort. The coldness of his hands and feet were an offering to the
Almighty. And tonight he sank on his knees; buried his face in his hands, and
prayed to God with all his might that He would make his club-foot whole. It was
a very small thing beside the moving of mountains. He knew that God could do it
if He wished, and his own faith was complete. Next morning, finishing his
prayers with the same request, he fixed a date for the miracle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, God, in Thy loving mercy and goodness, if it be Thy will, please
make my foot all right on the night before I go back to school.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was glad to get his petition into a formula, and he repeated it later in the
dining-room during the short pause which the Vicar always made after prayers,
before he rose from his knees. He said it again in the evening and again,
shivering in his nightshirt, before he got into bed. And he believed. For once
he looked forward with eagerness to the end of the holidays. He laughed to
himself as he thought of his uncle&rsquo;s astonishment when he ran down the
stairs three at a time; and after breakfast he and Aunt Louisa would have to
hurry out and buy a new pair of boots. At school they would be astounded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hulloa, Carey, what have you done with your foot?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all right now,&rdquo; he would answer casually, as though
it were the most natural thing in the world.
</p>

<p>
He would be able to play football. His heart leaped as he saw himself running,
running, faster than any of the other boys. At the end of the Easter term there
were the sports, and he would be able to go in for the races; he rather fancied
himself over the hurdles. It would be splendid to be like everyone else, not to
be stared at curiously by new boys who did not know about his deformity, nor at
the baths in summer to need incredible precautions, while he was undressing,
before he could hide his foot in the water.
</p>

<p>
He prayed with all the power of his soul. No doubts assailed him. He was
confident in the word of God. And the night before he was to go back to school
he went up to bed tremulous with excitement. There was snow on the ground, and
Aunt Louisa had allowed herself the unaccustomed luxury of a fire in her
bed-room; but in Philip&rsquo;s little room it was so cold that his fingers
were numb, and he had great difficulty in undoing his collar. His teeth
chattered. The idea came to him that he must do something more than usual to
attract the attention of God, and he turned back the rug which was in front of
his bed so that he could kneel on the bare boards; and then it struck him that
his nightshirt was a softness that might displease his Maker, so he took it off
and said his prayers naked. When he got into bed he was so cold that for some
time he could not sleep, but when he did, it was so soundly that Mary Ann had
to shake him when she brought in his hot water next morning. She talked to him
while she drew the curtains, but he did not answer; he had remembered at once
that this was the morning for the miracle. His heart was filled with joy and
gratitude. His first instinct was to put down his hand and feel the foot which
was whole now, but to do this seemed to doubt the goodness of God. He knew that
his foot was well. But at last he made up his mind, and with the toes of his
right foot he just touched his left. Then he passed his hand over it.
</p>

<p>
He limped downstairs just as Mary Ann was going into the dining-room for
prayers, and then he sat down to breakfast.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very quiet this morning, Philip,&rdquo; said Aunt Louisa
presently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s thinking of the good breakfast he&rsquo;ll have at school
to-morrow,&rdquo; said the Vicar.
</p>

<p>
When Philip answered, it was in a way that always irritated his uncle, with
something that had nothing to do with the matter in hand. He called it a bad
habit of wool-gathering.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Supposing you&rsquo;d asked God to do something,&rdquo; said Philip,
&ldquo;and really believed it was going to happen, like moving a mountain, I
mean, and you had faith, and it didn&rsquo;t happen, what would it mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a funny boy you are!&rdquo; said Aunt Louisa. &ldquo;You asked
about moving mountains two or three weeks ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It would just mean that you hadn&rsquo;t got faith,&rdquo; answered
Uncle William.
</p>

<p>
Philip accepted the explanation. If God had not cured him, it was because he
did not really believe. And yet he did not see how he could believe more than
he did. But perhaps he had not given God enough time. He had only asked Him for
nineteen days. In a day or two he began his prayer again, and this time he
fixed upon Easter. That was the day of His Son&rsquo;s glorious resurrection,
and God in His happiness might be mercifully inclined. But now Philip added
other means of attaining his desire: he began to wish, when he saw a new moon
or a dappled horse, and he looked out for shooting stars; during exeat they had
a chicken at the vicarage, and he broke the lucky bone with Aunt Louisa and
wished again, each time that his foot might be made whole. He was appealing
unconsciously to gods older to his race than the God of Israel. And he
bombarded the Almighty with his prayer, at odd times of the day, whenever it
occurred to him, in identical words always, for it seemed to him important to
make his request in the same terms. But presently the feeling came to him that
this time also his faith would not be great enough. He could not resist the
doubt that assailed him. He made his own experience into a general rule.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose no one ever has faith enough,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
It was like the salt which his nurse used to tell him about: you could catch
any bird by putting salt on his tail; and once he had taken a little bag of it
into Kensington Gardens. But he could never get near enough to put the salt on
a bird&rsquo;s tail. Before Easter he had given up the struggle. He felt a dull
resentment against his uncle for taking him in. The text which spoke of the
moving of mountains was just one of those that said one thing and meant
another. He thought his uncle had been playing a practical joke on him.

<h2>XV</h2>

<p>
The King&rsquo;s School at Tercanbury, to which Philip went when he was
thirteen, prided itself on its antiquity. It traced its origin to an abbey
school, founded before the Conquest, where the rudiments of learning were
taught by Augustine monks; and, like many another establishment of this sort,
on the destruction of the monasteries it had been reorganised by the officers
of King Henry VIII and thus acquired its name. Since then, pursuing its modest
course, it had given to the sons of the local gentry and of the professional
people of Kent an education sufficient to their needs. One or two men of
letters, beginning with a poet, than whom only Shakespeare had a more splendid
genius, and ending with a writer of prose whose view of life has affected
profoundly the generation of which Philip was a member, had gone forth from its
gates to achieve fame; it had produced one or two eminent lawyers, but eminent
lawyers are common, and one or two soldiers of distinction; but during the
three centuries since its separation from the monastic order it had trained
especially men of the church, bishops, deans, canons, and above all country
clergymen: there were boys in the school whose fathers, grandfathers,
great-grandfathers, had been educated there and had all been rectors of
parishes in the diocese of Tercanbury; and they came to it with their minds
made up already to be ordained. But there were signs notwithstanding that even
there changes were coming; for a few, repeating what they had heard at home,
said that the Church was no longer what it used to be. It wasn&rsquo;t so much
the money; but the class of people who went in for it weren&rsquo;t the same;
and two or three boys knew curates whose fathers were tradesmen: they&rsquo;d
rather go out to the Colonies (in those days the Colonies were still the last
hope of those who could get nothing to do in England) than be a curate under
some chap who wasn&rsquo;t a gentleman. At King&rsquo;s School, as at
Blackstable Vicarage, a tradesman was anyone who was not lucky enough to own
land (and here a fine distinction was made between the gentleman farmer and the
landowner), or did not follow one of the four professions to which it was
possible for a gentleman to belong. Among the day-boys, of whom there were
about a hundred and fifty, sons of the local gentry and of the men stationed at
the depot, those whose fathers were engaged in business were made to feel the
degradation of their state.
</p>

<p>
The masters had no patience with modern ideas of education, which they read of
sometimes in The Times or The Guardian, and hoped fervently that King&rsquo;s
School would remain true to its old traditions. The dead languages were taught
with such thoroughness that an old boy seldom thought of Homer or Virgil in
after life without a qualm of boredom; and though in the common room at dinner
one or two bolder spirits suggested that mathematics were of increasing
importance, the general feeling was that they were a less noble study than the
classics. Neither German nor chemistry was taught, and French only by the
form-masters; they could keep order better than a foreigner, and, since they
knew the grammar as well as any Frenchman, it seemed unimportant that none of
them could have got a cup of coffee in the restaurant at Boulogne unless the
waiter had known a little English. Geography was taught chiefly by making boys
draw maps, and this was a favourite occupation, especially when the country
dealt with was mountainous: it was possible to waste a great deal of time in
drawing the Andes or the Apennines. The masters, graduates of Oxford or
Cambridge, were ordained and unmarried; if by chance they wished to marry they
could only do so by accepting one of the smaller livings at the disposal of the
Chapter; but for many years none of them had cared to leave the refined society
of Tercanbury, which owing to the cavalry depot had a martial as well as an
ecclesiastical tone, for the monotony of life in a country rectory; and they
were now all men of middle age.
</p>

<p>
The headmaster, on the other hand, was obliged to be married and he conducted
the school till age began to tell upon him. When he retired he was rewarded
with a much better living than any of the under-masters could hope for, and an
honorary Canonry.
</p>

<p>
But a year before Philip entered the school a great change had come over it. It
had been obvious for some time that Dr. Fleming, who had been headmaster for
the quarter of a century, was become too deaf to continue his work to the
greater glory of God; and when one of the livings on the outskirts of the city
fell vacant, with a stipend of six hundred a year, the Chapter offered it to
him in such a manner as to imply that they thought it high time for him to
retire. He could nurse his ailments comfortably on such an income. Two or three
curates who had hoped for preferment told their wives it was scandalous to give
a parish that needed a young, strong, and energetic man to an old fellow who
knew nothing of parochial work, and had feathered his nest already; but the
mutterings of the unbeneficed clergy do not reach the ears of a cathedral
Chapter. And as for the parishioners they had nothing to say in the matter, and
therefore nobody asked for their opinion. The Wesleyans and the Baptists both
had chapels in the village.
</p>

<p>
When Dr. Fleming was thus disposed of it became necessary to find a successor.
It was contrary to the traditions of the school that one of the lower-masters
should be chosen. The common-room was unanimous in desiring the election of Mr.
Watson, headmaster of the preparatory school; he could hardly be described as
already a master of King&rsquo;s School, they had all known him for twenty
years, and there was no danger that he would make a nuisance of himself. But
the Chapter sprang a surprise on them. It chose a man called Perkins. At first
nobody knew who Perkins was, and the name favourably impressed no one; but
before the shock of it had passed away, it was realised that Perkins was the
son of Perkins the linendraper. Dr. Fleming informed the masters just before
dinner, and his manner showed his consternation. Such of them as were dining
in, ate their meal almost in silence, and no reference was made to the matter
till the servants had left the room. Then they set to. The names of those
present on this occasion are unimportant, but they had been known to
generations of school-boys as Sighs, Tar, Winks, Squirts, and Pat.
</p>

<p>
They all knew Tom Perkins. The first thing about him was that he was not a
gentleman. They remembered him quite well. He was a small, dark boy, with
untidy black hair and large eyes. He looked like a gipsy. He had come to the
school as a day-boy, with the best scholarship on their endowment, so that his
education had cost him nothing. Of course he was brilliant. At every Speech-Day
he was loaded with prizes. He was their show-boy, and they remembered now
bitterly their fear that he would try to get some scholarship at one of the
larger public schools and so pass out of their hands. Dr. Fleming had gone to
the linendraper his father&mdash;they all remembered the shop, Perkins and
Cooper, in St. Catherine&rsquo;s Street&mdash;and said he hoped Tom would
remain with them till he went to Oxford. The school was Perkins and
Cooper&rsquo;s best customer, and Mr. Perkins was only too glad to give the
required assurance. Tom Perkins continued to triumph, he was the finest
classical scholar that Dr. Fleming remembered, and on leaving the school took
with him the most valuable scholarship they had to offer. He got another at
Magdalen and settled down to a brilliant career at the University. The school
magazine recorded the distinctions he achieved year after year, and when he got
his double first Dr. Fleming himself wrote a few words of eulogy on the front
page. It was with greater satisfaction that they welcomed his success, since
Perkins and Cooper had fallen upon evil days: Cooper drank like a fish, and
just before Tom Perkins took his degree the linendrapers filed their petition
in bankruptcy.
</p>

<p>
In due course Tom Perkins took Holy Orders and entered upon the profession for
which he was so admirably suited. He had been an assistant master at Wellington
and then at Rugby.
</p>

<p>
But there was quite a difference between welcoming his success at other schools
and serving under his leadership in their own. Tar had frequently given him
lines, and Squirts had boxed his ears. They could not imagine how the Chapter
had made such a mistake. No one could be expected to forget that he was the son
of a bankrupt linendraper, and the alcoholism of Cooper seemed to increase the
disgrace. It was understood that the Dean had supported his candidature with
zeal, so the Dean would probably ask him to dinner; but would the pleasant
little dinners in the precincts ever be the same when Tom Perkins sat at the
table? And what about the depot? He really could not expect officers and
gentlemen to receive him as one of themselves. It would do the school
incalculable harm. Parents would be dissatisfied, and no one could be surprised
if there were wholesale withdrawals. And then the indignity of calling him Mr.
Perkins! The masters thought by way of protest of sending in their resignations
in a body, but the uneasy fear that they would be accepted with equanimity
restrained them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The only thing is to prepare ourselves for changes,&rdquo; said Sighs,
who had conducted the fifth form for five and twenty years with unparalleled
incompetence.
</p>

<p>
And when they saw him they were not reassured. Dr. Fleming invited them to meet
him at luncheon. He was now a man of thirty-two, tall and lean, but with the
same wild and unkempt look they remembered on him as a boy. His clothes,
ill-made and shabby, were put on untidily. His hair was as black and as long as
ever, and he had plainly never learned to brush it; it fell over his forehead
with every gesture, and he had a quick movement of the hand with which he
pushed it back from his eyes. He had a black moustache and a beard which came
high up on his face almost to the cheek-bones, He talked to the masters quite
easily, as though he had parted from them a week or two before; he was
evidently delighted to see them. He seemed unconscious of the strangeness of
the position and appeared not to notice any oddness in being addressed as Mr.
Perkins.
</p>

<p>
When he bade them good-bye, one of the masters, for something to say, remarked
that he was allowing himself plenty of time to catch his train.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want to go round and have a look at the shop,&rdquo; he answered
cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
There was a distinct embarrassment. They wondered that he could be so tactless,
and to make it worse Dr. Fleming had not heard what he said. His wife shouted
it in his ear.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He wants to go round and look at his father&rsquo;s old shop.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Only Tom Perkins was unconscious of the humiliation which the whole party felt.
He turned to Mrs. Fleming.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s got it now, d&rsquo;you know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She could hardly answer. She was very angry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still a linendraper&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she said bitterly.
&ldquo;Grove is the name. We don&rsquo;t deal there any more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder if he&rsquo;d let me go over the house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I expect he would if you explain who you are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was not till the end of dinner that evening that any reference was made in
the common-room to the subject that was in all their minds. Then it was Sighs
who asked:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what did you think of our new head?&rdquo; They thought of the
conversation at luncheon. It was hardly a conversation; it was a monologue.
Perkins had talked incessantly. He talked very quickly, with a flow of easy
words and in a deep, resonant voice. He had a short, odd little laugh which
showed his white teeth. They had followed him with difficulty, for his mind
darted from subject to subject with a connection they did not always catch. He
talked of pedagogics, and this was natural enough; but he had much to say of
modern theories in Germany which they had never heard of and received with
misgiving. He talked of the classics, but he had been to Greece, and he
discoursed of archaeology; he had once spent a winter digging; they could not
see how that helped a man to teach boys to pass examinations, He talked of
politics. It sounded odd to them to hear him compare Lord Beaconsfield with
Alcibiades. He talked of Mr. Gladstone and Home Rule. They realised that he was
a Liberal. Their hearts sank. He talked of German philosophy and of French
fiction. They could not think a man profound whose interests were so diverse.
</p>

<p>
It was Winks who summed up the general impression and put it into a form they
all felt conclusively damning. Winks was the master of the upper third, a
weak-kneed man with drooping eye-lids, He was too tall for his strength, and
his movements were slow and languid. He gave an impression of lassitude, and
his nickname was eminently appropriate.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very enthusiastic,&rdquo; said Winks.
</p>

<p>
Enthusiasm was ill-bred. Enthusiasm was ungentlemanly. They thought of the
Salvation Army with its braying trumpets and its drums. Enthusiasm meant
change. They had goose-flesh when they thought of all the pleasant old habits
which stood in imminent danger. They hardly dared to look forward to the
future.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He looks more of a gipsy than ever,&rdquo; said one, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder if the Dean and Chapter knew that he was a Radical when they
elected him,&rdquo; another observed bitterly.
</p>

<p>
But conversation halted. They were too much disturbed for words.
</p>

<p>
When Tar and Sighs were walking together to the Chapter House on Speech-Day a
week later, Tar, who had a bitter tongue, remarked to his colleague:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve seen a good many Speech-Days here, haven&rsquo;t we? I
wonder if we shall see another.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sighs was more melancholy even than usual.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If anything worth having comes along in the way of a living I
don&rsquo;t mind when I retire.&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>XVI</h2>

<p>
A year passed, and when Philip came to the school the old masters were all in
their places; but a good many changes had taken place notwithstanding their
stubborn resistance, none the less formidable because it was concealed under an
apparent desire to fall in with the new head&rsquo;s ideas. Though the
form-masters still taught French to the lower school, another master had come,
with a degree of doctor of philology from the University of Heidelberg and a
record of three years spent in a French lycee, to teach French to the upper
forms and German to anyone who cared to take it up instead of Greek. Another
master was engaged to teach mathematics more systematically than had been found
necessary hitherto. Neither of these was ordained. This was a real revolution,
and when the pair arrived the older masters received them with distrust. A
laboratory had been fitted up, army classes were instituted; they all said the
character of the school was changing. And heaven only knew what further
projects Mr. Perkins turned in that untidy head of his. The school was small as
public schools go, there were not more than two hundred boarders; and it was
difficult for it to grow larger, for it was huddled up against the Cathedral;
the precincts, with the exception of a house in which some of the masters
lodged, were occupied by the cathedral clergy; and there was no more room for
building. But Mr. Perkins devised an elaborate scheme by which he might obtain
sufficient space to make the school double its present size. He wanted to
attract boys from London. He thought it would be good for them to be thrown in
contact with the Kentish lads, and it would sharpen the country wits of these.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s against all our traditions,&rdquo; said Sighs, when Mr.
Perkins made the suggestion to him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve rather gone out of our
way to avoid the contamination of boys from London.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, what nonsense!&rdquo; said Mr. Perkins.
</p>

<p>
No one had ever told the form-master before that he talked nonsense, and he was
meditating an acid reply, in which perhaps he might insert a veiled reference
to hosiery, when Mr. Perkins in his impetuous way attacked him outrageously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That house in the precincts&mdash;if you&rsquo;d only marry I&rsquo;d
get the Chapter to put another couple of stories on, and we&rsquo;d make
dormitories and studies, and your wife could help you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The elderly clergyman gasped. Why should he marry? He was fifty-seven, a man
couldn&rsquo;t marry at fifty-seven. He couldn&rsquo;t start looking after a
house at his time of life. He didn&rsquo;t want to marry. If the choice lay
between that and the country living he would much sooner resign. All he wanted
now was peace and quietness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not thinking of marrying,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Perkins looked at him with his dark, bright eyes, and if there was a
twinkle in them poor Sighs never saw it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a pity! Couldn&rsquo;t you marry to oblige me? It would help me a
great deal with the Dean and Chapter when I suggest rebuilding your
house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Mr. Perkins&rsquo; most unpopular innovation was his system of taking
occasionally another man&rsquo;s form. He asked it as a favour, but after all
it was a favour which could not be refused, and as Tar, otherwise Mr. Turner,
said, it was undignified for all parties. He gave no warning, but after morning
prayers would say to one of the masters:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder if you&rsquo;d mind taking the Sixth today at eleven.
We&rsquo;ll change over, shall we?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They did not know whether this was usual at other schools, but certainly it had
never been done at Tercanbury. The results were curious. Mr. Turner, who was
the first victim, broke the news to his form that the headmaster would take
them for Latin that day, and on the pretence that they might like to ask him a
question or two so that they should not make perfect fools of themselves, spent
the last quarter of an hour of the history lesson in construing for them the
passage of Livy which had been set for the day; but when he rejoined his class
and looked at the paper on which Mr. Perkins had written the marks, a surprise
awaited him; for the two boys at the top of the form seemed to have done very
ill, while others who had never distinguished themselves before were given full
marks. When he asked Eldridge, his cleverest boy, what was the meaning of this
the answer came sullenly:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Perkins never gave us any construing to do. He asked me what I knew
about General Gordon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Turner looked at him in astonishment. The boys evidently felt they had been
hardly used, and he could not help agreeing with their silent dissatisfaction.
He could not see either what General Gordon had to do with Livy. He hazarded an
inquiry afterwards.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eldridge was dreadfully put out because you asked him what he knew about
General Gordon,&rdquo; he said to the headmaster, with an attempt at a chuckle.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Perkins laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I saw they&rsquo;d got to the agrarian laws of Caius Gracchus, and I
wondered if they knew anything about the agrarian troubles in Ireland. But all
they knew about Ireland was that Dublin was on the Liffey. So I wondered if
they&rsquo;d ever heard of General Gordon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then the horrid fact was disclosed that the new head had a mania for general
information. He had doubts about the utility of examinations on subjects which
had been crammed for the occasion. He wanted common sense.
</p>

<p>
Sighs grew more worried every month; he could not get the thought out of his
head that Mr. Perkins would ask him to fix a day for his marriage; and he hated
the attitude the head adopted towards classical literature. There was no doubt
that he was a fine scholar, and he was engaged on a work which was quite in the
right tradition: he was writing a treatise on the trees in Latin literature;
but he talked of it flippantly, as though it were a pastime of no great
importance, like billiards, which engaged his leisure but was not to be
considered with seriousness. And Squirts, the master of the Middle Third, grew
more ill-tempered every day.
</p>

<p>
It was in his form that Philip was put on entering the school. The Rev. B. B.
Gordon was a man by nature ill-suited to be a schoolmaster: he was impatient
and choleric. With no one to call him to account, with only small boys to face
him, he had long lost all power of self-control. He began his work in a rage
and ended it in a passion. He was a man of middle height and of a corpulent
figure; he had sandy hair, worn very short and now growing gray, and a small
bristly moustache. His large face, with indistinct features and small blue
eyes, was naturally red, but during his frequent attacks of anger it grew dark
and purple. His nails were bitten to the quick, for while some trembling boy
was construing he would sit at his desk shaking with the fury that consumed
him, and gnaw his fingers. Stories, perhaps exaggerated, were told of his
violence, and two years before there had been some excitement in the school
when it was heard that one father was threatening a prosecution: he had boxed
the ears of a boy named Walters with a book so violently that his hearing was
affected and the boy had to be taken away from the school. The boy&rsquo;s
father lived in Tercanbury, and there had been much indignation in the city,
the local paper had referred to the matter; but Mr. Walters was only a brewer,
so the sympathy was divided. The rest of the boys, for reasons best known to
themselves, though they loathed the master, took his side in the affair, and,
to show their indignation that the school&rsquo;s business had been dealt with
outside, made things as uncomfortable as they could for Walters&rsquo; younger
brother, who still remained. But Mr. Gordon had only escaped the country living
by the skin of his teeth, and he had never hit a boy since. The right the
masters possessed to cane boys on the hand was taken away from them, and
Squirts could no longer emphasize his anger by beating his desk with the cane.
He never did more now than take a boy by the shoulders and shake him. He still
made a naughty or refractory lad stand with one arm stretched out for anything
from ten minutes to half an hour, and he was as violent as before with his
tongue.
</p>

<p>
No master could have been more unfitted to teach things to so shy a boy as
Philip. He had come to the school with fewer terrors than he had when first he
went to Mr. Watson&rsquo;s. He knew a good many boys who had been with him at
the preparatory school. He felt more grownup, and instinctively realised that
among the larger numbers his deformity would be less noticeable. But from the
first day Mr. Gordon struck terror in his heart; and the master, quick to
discern the boys who were frightened of him, seemed on that account to take a
peculiar dislike to him. Philip had enjoyed his work, but now he began to look
upon the hours passed in school with horror. Rather than risk an answer which
might be wrong and excite a storm of abuse from the master, he would sit
stupidly silent, and when it came towards his turn to stand up and construe he
grew sick and white with apprehension. His happy moments were those when Mr.
Perkins took the form. He was able to gratify the passion for general knowledge
which beset the headmaster; he had read all sorts of strange books beyond his
years, and often Mr. Perkins, when a question was going round the room, would
stop at Philip with a smile that filled the boy with rapture, and say:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, Carey, you tell them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The good marks he got on these occasions increased Mr. Gordon&rsquo;s
indignation. One day it came to Philip&rsquo;s turn to translate, and the
master sat there glaring at him and furiously biting his thumb. He was in a
ferocious mood. Philip began to speak in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mumble,&rdquo; shouted the master.
</p>

<p>
Something seemed to stick in Philip&rsquo;s throat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go on. Go on. Go on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Each time the words were screamed more loudly. The effect was to drive all he
knew out of Philip&rsquo;s head, and he looked at the printed page vacantly.
Mr. Gordon began to breathe heavily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t know why don&rsquo;t you say so? Do you know it or
not? Did you hear all this construed last time or not? Why don&rsquo;t you
speak? Speak, you blockhead, speak!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The master seized the arms of his chair and grasped them as though to prevent
himself from falling upon Philip. They knew that in past days he often used to
seize boys by the throat till they almost choked. The veins in his forehead
stood out and his face grew dark and threatening. He was a man insane.
</p>

<p>
Philip had known the passage perfectly the day before, but now he could
remember nothing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know it,&rdquo; he gasped.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you know it? Let&rsquo;s take the words one by one.
We&rsquo;ll soon see if you don&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip stood silent, very white, trembling a little, with his head bent down on
the book. The master&rsquo;s breathing grew almost stertorous.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The headmaster says you&rsquo;re clever. I don&rsquo;t know how he sees
it. General information.&rdquo; He laughed savagely. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
what they put you in his form for, Blockhead.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was pleased with the word, and he repeated it at the top of his voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Blockhead! Blockhead! Club-footed blockhead!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That relieved him a little. He saw Philip redden suddenly. He told him to fetch
the Black Book. Philip put down his Caesar and went silently out. The Black
Book was a sombre volume in which the names of boys were written with their
misdeeds, and when a name was down three times it meant a caning. Philip went
to the headmaster&rsquo;s house and knocked at his study-door. Mr. Perkins was
seated at his table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;May I have the Black Book, please, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There it is,&rdquo; answered Mr. Perkins, indicating its place by a nod
of his head. &ldquo;What have you been doing that you shouldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Perkins gave him a quick look, but without answering went on with his work.
Philip took the book and went out. When the hour was up, a few minutes later,
he brought it back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me have a look at it,&rdquo; said the headmaster. &ldquo;I see Mr.
Gordon has black-booked you for &lsquo;gross impertinence.&rsquo; What was
it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir. Mr. Gordon said I was a club-footed
blockhead.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Perkins looked at him again. He wondered whether there was sarcasm behind
the boy&rsquo;s reply, but he was still much too shaken. His face was white and
his eyes had a look of terrified distress. Mr. Perkins got up and put the book
down. As he did so he took up some photographs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A friend of mine sent me some pictures of Athens this morning,&rdquo; he
said casually. &ldquo;Look here, there&rsquo;s the Akropolis.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He began explaining to Philip what he saw. The ruin grew vivid with his words.
He showed him the theatre of Dionysus and explained in what order the people
sat, and how beyond they could see the blue Aegean. And then suddenly he said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I remember Mr. Gordon used to call me a gipsy counter-jumper when I was
in his form.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And before Philip, his mind fixed on the photographs, had time to gather the
meaning of the remark, Mr. Perkins was showing him a picture of Salamis, and
with his finger, a finger of which the nail had a little black edge to it, was
pointing out how the Greek ships were placed and how the Persian.

<h2>XVII</h2>

<p>
Philip passed the next two years with comfortable monotony. He was not bullied
more than other boys of his size; and his deformity, withdrawing him from
games, acquired for him an insignificance for which he was grateful. He was not
popular, and he was very lonely. He spent a couple of terms with Winks in the
Upper Third. Winks, with his weary manner and his drooping eyelids, looked
infinitely bored. He did his duty, but he did it with an abstracted mind. He
was kind, gentle, and foolish. He had a great belief in the honour of boys; he
felt that the first thing to make them truthful was not to let it enter your
head for a moment that it was possible for them to lie. &ldquo;Ask much,&rdquo;
he quoted, &ldquo;and much shall be given to you.&rdquo; Life was easy in the
Upper Third. You knew exactly what lines would come to your turn to construe,
and with the crib that passed from hand to hand you could find out all you
wanted in two minutes; you could hold a Latin Grammar open on your knees while
questions were passing round; and Winks never noticed anything odd in the fact
that the same incredible mistake was to be found in a dozen different
exercises. He had no great faith in examinations, for he noticed that boys
never did so well in them as in form: it was disappointing, but not
significant. In due course they were moved up, having learned little but a
cheerful effrontery in the distortion of truth, which was possibly of greater
service to them in after life than an ability to read Latin at sight.
</p>

<p>
Then they fell into the hands of Tar. His name was Turner; he was the most
vivacious of the old masters, a short man with an immense belly, a black beard
turning now to gray, and a swarthy skin. In his clerical dress there was indeed
something in him to suggest the tar-barrel; and though on principle he gave
five hundred lines to any boy on whose lips he overheard his nickname, at
dinner-parties in the precincts he often made little jokes about it. He was the
most worldly of the masters; he dined out more frequently than any of the
others, and the society he kept was not so exclusively clerical. The boys
looked upon him as rather a dog. He left off his clerical attire during the
holidays and had been seen in Switzerland in gay tweeds. He liked a bottle of
wine and a good dinner, and having once been seen at the Cafe Royal with a lady
who was very probably a near relation, was thenceforward supposed by
generations of schoolboys to indulge in orgies the circumstantial details of
which pointed to an unbounded belief in human depravity.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Turner reckoned that it took him a term to lick boys into shape after they
had been in the Upper Third; and now and then he let fall a sly hint, which
showed that he knew perfectly what went on in his colleague&rsquo;s form. He
took it good-humouredly. He looked upon boys as young ruffians who were more
apt to be truthful if it was quite certain a lie would be found out, whose
sense of honour was peculiar to themselves and did not apply to dealings with
masters, and who were least likely to be troublesome when they learned that it
did not pay. He was proud of his form and as eager at fifty-five that it should
do better in examinations than any of the others as he had been when he first
came to the school. He had the choler of the obese, easily roused and as easily
calmed, and his boys soon discovered that there was much kindliness beneath the
invective with which he constantly assailed them. He had no patience with
fools, but was willing to take much trouble with boys whom he suspected of
concealing intelligence behind their wilfulness. He was fond of inviting them
to tea; and, though vowing they never got a look in with him at the cakes and
muffins, for it was the fashion to believe that his corpulence pointed to a
voracious appetite, and his voracious appetite to tapeworms, they accepted his
invitations with real pleasure.
</p>

<p>
Philip was now more comfortable, for space was so limited that there were only
studies for boys in the upper school, and till then he had lived in the great
hall in which they all ate and in which the lower forms did preparation in a
promiscuity which was vaguely distasteful to him. Now and then it made him
restless to be with people and he wanted urgently to be alone. He set out for
solitary walks into the country. There was a little stream, with pollards on
both sides of it, that ran through green fields, and it made him happy, he knew
not why, to wander along its banks. When he was tired he lay face-downward on
the grass and watched the eager scurrying of minnows and of tadpoles. It gave
him a peculiar satisfaction to saunter round the precincts. On the green in the
middle they practised at nets in the summer, but during the rest of the year it
was quiet: boys used to wander round sometimes arm in arm, or a studious fellow
with abstracted gaze walked slowly, repeating to himself something he had to
learn by heart. There was a colony of rooks in the great elms, and they filled
the air with melancholy cries. Along one side lay the Cathedral with its great
central tower, and Philip, who knew as yet nothing of beauty, felt when he
looked at it a troubling delight which he could not understand. When he had a
study (it was a little square room looking on a slum, and four boys shared it),
he bought a photograph of that view of the Cathedral, and pinned it up over his
desk. And he found himself taking a new interest in what he saw from the window
of the Fourth Form room. It looked on to old lawns, carefully tended, and fine
trees with foliage dense and rich. It gave him an odd feeling in his heart, and
he did not know if it was pain or pleasure. It was the first dawn of the
aesthetic emotion. It accompanied other changes. His voice broke. It was no
longer quite under his control, and queer sounds issued from his throat.
</p>

<p>
Then he began to go to the classes which were held in the headmaster&rsquo;s
study, immediately after tea, to prepare boys for confirmation. Philip&rsquo;s
piety had not stood the test of time, and he had long since given up his
nightly reading of the Bible; but now, under the influence of Mr. Perkins, with
this new condition of the body which made him so restless, his old feelings
revived, and he reproached himself bitterly for his backsliding. The fires of
Hell burned fiercely before his mind&rsquo;s eye. If he had died during that
time when he was little better than an infidel he would have been lost; he
believed implicitly in pain everlasting, he believed in it much more than in
eternal happiness; and he shuddered at the dangers he had run.
</p>

<p>
Since the day on which Mr. Perkins had spoken kindly to him, when he was
smarting under the particular form of abuse which he could least bear, Philip
had conceived for his headmaster a dog-like adoration. He racked his brains
vainly for some way to please him. He treasured the smallest word of
commendation which by chance fell from his lips. And when he came to the quiet
little meetings in his house he was prepared to surrender himself entirely. He
kept his eyes fixed on Mr. Perkins&rsquo; shining eyes, and sat with mouth half
open, his head a little thrown forward so as to miss no word. The ordinariness
of the surroundings made the matters they dealt with extraordinarily moving.
And often the master, seized himself by the wonder of his subject, would push
back the book in front of him, and with his hands clasped together over his
heart, as though to still the beating, would talk of the mysteries of their
religion. Sometimes Philip did not understand, but he did not want to
understand, he felt vaguely that it was enough to feel. It seemed to him then
that the headmaster, with his black, straggling hair and his pale face, was
like those prophets of Israel who feared not to take kings to task; and when he
thought of the Redeemer he saw Him only with the same dark eyes and those wan
cheeks.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Perkins took this part of his work with great seriousness. There was never
here any of that flashing humour which made the other masters suspect him of
flippancy. Finding time for everything in his busy day, he was able at certain
intervals to take separately for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes the
boys whom he was preparing for confirmation. He wanted to make them feel that
this was the first consciously serious step in their lives; he tried to grope
into the depths of their souls; he wanted to instil in them his own vehement
devotion. In Philip, notwithstanding his shyness, he felt the possibility of a
passion equal to his own. The boy&rsquo;s temperament seemed to him essentially
religious. One day he broke off suddenly from the subject on which he had been
talking.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you thought at all what you&rsquo;re going to be when you grow
up?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My uncle wants me to be ordained,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip looked away. He was ashamed to answer that he felt himself unworthy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any life that&rsquo;s so full of happiness as ours. I
wish I could make you feel what a wonderful privilege it is. One can serve God
in every walk, but we stand nearer to Him. I don&rsquo;t want to influence you,
but if you made up your mind&mdash;oh, at once&mdash;you couldn&rsquo;t help
feeling that joy and relief which never desert one again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip did not answer, but the headmaster read in his eyes that he realised
already something of what he tried to indicate.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you go on as you are now you&rsquo;ll find yourself head of the
school one of these days, and you ought to be pretty safe for a scholarship
when you leave. Have you got anything of your own?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My uncle says I shall have a hundred a year when I&rsquo;m
twenty-one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be rich. I had nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The headmaster hesitated a moment, and then, idly drawing lines with a pencil
on the blotting paper in front of him, went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid your choice of professions will be rather limited. You
naturally couldn&rsquo;t go in for anything that required physical
activity.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip reddened to the roots of his hair, as he always did when any reference
was made to his club-foot. Mr. Perkins looked at him gravely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder if you&rsquo;re not oversensitive about your misfortune. Has it
ever struck you to thank God for it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip looked up quickly. His lips tightened. He remembered how for months,
trusting in what they told him, he had implored God to heal him as He had
healed the Leper and made the Blind to see.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As long as you accept it rebelliously it can only cause you shame. But
if you looked upon it as a cross that was given you to bear only because your
shoulders were strong enough to bear it, a sign of God&rsquo;s favour, then it
would be a source of happiness to you instead of misery.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He saw that the boy hated to discuss the matter and he let him go.
</p>

<p>
But Philip thought over all that the headmaster had said, and presently, his
mind taken up entirely with the ceremony that was before him, a mystical
rapture seized him. His spirit seemed to free itself from the bonds of the
flesh and he seemed to be living a new life. He aspired to perfection with all
the passion that was in him. He wanted to surrender himself entirely to the
service of God, and he made up his mind definitely that he would be ordained.
When the great day arrived, his soul deeply moved by all the preparation, by
the books he had studied and above all by the overwhelming influence of the
head, he could hardly contain himself for fear and joy. One thought had
tormented him. He knew that he would have to walk alone through the chancel,
and he dreaded showing his limp thus obviously, not only to the whole school,
who were attending the service, but also to the strangers, people from the city
or parents who had come to see their sons confirmed. But when the time came he
felt suddenly that he could accept the humiliation joyfully; and as he limped
up the chancel, very small and insignificant beneath the lofty vaulting of the
Cathedral, he offered consciously his deformity as a sacrifice to the God who
loved him.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>XVIII</h2>

<p>
But Philip could not live long in the rarefied air of the hilltops. What had
happened to him when first he was seized by the religious emotion happened to
him now. Because he felt so keenly the beauty of faith, because the desire for
self-sacrifice burned in his heart with such a gem-like glow, his strength
seemed inadequate to his ambition. He was tired out by the violence of his
passion. His soul was filled on a sudden with a singular aridity. He began to
forget the presence of God which had seemed so surrounding; and his religious
exercises, still very punctually performed, grew merely formal. At first he
blamed himself for this falling away, and the fear of hell-fire urged him to
renewed vehemence; but the passion was dead, and gradually other interests
distracted his thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Philip had few friends. His habit of reading isolated him: it became such a
need that after being in company for some time he grew tired and restless; he
was vain of the wider knowledge he had acquired from the perusal of so many
books, his mind was alert, and he had not the skill to hide his contempt for
his companions&rsquo; stupidity. They complained that he was conceited; and,
since he excelled only in matters which to them were unimportant, they asked
satirically what he had to be conceited about. He was developing a sense of
humour, and found that he had a knack of saying bitter things, which caught
people on the raw; he said them because they amused him, hardly realising how
much they hurt, and was much offended when he found that his victims regarded
him with active dislike. The humiliations he suffered when first he went to
school had caused in him a shrinking from his fellows which he could never
entirely overcome; he remained shy and silent. But though he did everything to
alienate the sympathy of other boys he longed with all his heart for the
popularity which to some was so easily accorded. These from his distance he
admired extravagantly; and though he was inclined to be more sarcastic with
them than with others, though he made little jokes at their expense, he would
have given anything to change places with them. Indeed he would gladly have
changed places with the dullest boy in the school who was whole of limb. He
took to a singular habit. He would imagine that he was some boy whom he had a
particular fancy for; he would throw his soul, as it were, into the
other&rsquo;s body, talk with his voice and laugh with his heart; he would
imagine himself doing all the things the other did. It was so vivid that he
seemed for a moment really to be no longer himself. In this way he enjoyed many
intervals of fantastic happiness.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of the Christmas term which followed on his confirmation
Philip found himself moved into another study. One of the boys who shared it
was called Rose. He was in the same form as Philip, and Philip had always
looked upon him with envious admiration. He was not good-looking; though his
large hands and big bones suggested that he would be a tall man, he was
clumsily made; but his eyes were charming, and when he laughed (he was
constantly laughing) his face wrinkled all round them in a jolly way. He was
neither clever nor stupid, but good enough at his work and better at games. He
was a favourite with masters and boys, and he in his turn liked everyone.
</p>

<p>
When Philip was put in the study he could not help seeing that the others, who
had been together for three terms, welcomed him coldly. It made him nervous to
feel himself an intruder; but he had learned to hide his feelings, and they
found him quiet and unobtrusive. With Rose, because he was as little able as
anyone else to resist his charm, Philip was even more than usually shy and
abrupt; and whether on account of this, unconsciously bent upon exerting the
fascination he knew was his only by the results, or whether from sheer kindness
of heart, it was Rose who first took Philip into the circle. One day, quite
suddenly, he asked Philip if he would walk to the football field with him.
Philip flushed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t walk fast enough for you,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rot. Come on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And just before they were setting out some boy put his head in the study-door
and asked Rose to go with him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already promised
Carey.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother about me,&rdquo; said Philip quickly. &ldquo;I
shan&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rot,&rdquo; said Rose.
</p>

<p>
He looked at Philip with those good-natured eyes of his and laughed. Philip
felt a curious tremor in his heart.
</p>

<p>
In a little while, their friendship growing with boyish rapidity, the pair were
inseparable. Other fellows wondered at the sudden intimacy, and Rose was asked
what he saw in Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not half a
bad chap really.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Soon they grew accustomed to the two walking into chapel arm in arm or
strolling round the precincts in conversation; wherever one was the other could
be found also, and, as though acknowledging his proprietorship, boys who wanted
Rose would leave messages with Carey. Philip at first was reserved. He would
not let himself yield entirely to the proud joy that filled him; but presently
his distrust of the fates gave way before a wild happiness. He thought Rose the
most wonderful fellow he had ever seen. His books now were insignificant; he
could not bother about them when there was something infinitely more important
to occupy him. Rose&rsquo;s friends used to come in to tea in the study
sometimes or sit about when there was nothing better to do&mdash;Rose liked a
crowd and the chance of a rag&mdash;and they found that Philip was quite a
decent fellow. Philip was happy.
</p>

<p>
When the last day of term came he and Rose arranged by which train they should
come back, so that they might meet at the station and have tea in the town
before returning to school. Philip went home with a heavy heart. He thought of
Rose all through the holidays, and his fancy was active with the things they
would do together next term. He was bored at the vicarage, and when on the last
day his uncle put him the usual question in the usual facetious tone:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, are you glad to be going back to school?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip answered joyfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rather.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In order to be sure of meeting Rose at the station he took an earlier train
than he usually did, and he waited about the platform for an hour. When the
train came in from Faversham, where he knew Rose had to change, he ran along it
excitedly. But Rose was not there. He got a porter to tell him when another
train was due, and he waited; but again he was disappointed; and he was cold
and hungry, so he walked, through side-streets and slums, by a short cut to the
school. He found Rose in the study, with his feet on the chimney-piece, talking
eighteen to the dozen with half a dozen boys who were sitting on whatever there
was to sit on. He shook hands with Philip enthusiastically, but Philip&rsquo;s
face fell, for he realised that Rose had forgotten all about their appointment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, why are you so late?&rdquo; said Rose. &ldquo;I thought you were
never coming.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You were at the station at half-past four,&rdquo; said another boy.
&ldquo;I saw you when I came.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip blushed a little. He did not want Rose to know that he had been such a
fool as to wait for him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I had to see about a friend of my people&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he invented
readily. &ldquo;I was asked to see her off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But his disappointment made him a little sulky. He sat in silence, and when
spoken to answered in monosyllables. He was making up his mind to have it out
with Rose when they were alone. But when the others had gone Rose at once came
over and sat on the arm of the chair in which Philip was lounging.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, I&rsquo;m jolly glad we&rsquo;re in the same study this term.
Ripping, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He seemed so genuinely pleased to see Philip that Philip&rsquo;s annoyance
vanished. They began as if they had not been separated for five minutes to talk
eagerly of the thousand things that interested them.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">

<h2>XIX</h2>

<p>
At first Philip had been too grateful for Rose&rsquo;s friendship to make any
demands on him. He took things as they came and enjoyed life. But presently he
began to resent Rose&rsquo;s universal amiability; he wanted a more exclusive
attachment, and he claimed as a right what before he had accepted as a favour.
He watched jealously Rose&rsquo;s companionship with others; and though he knew
it was unreasonable could not help sometimes saying bitter things to him. If
Rose spent an hour playing the fool in another study, Philip would receive him
when he returned to his own with a sullen frown. He would sulk for a day, and
he suffered more because Rose either did not notice his ill-humour or
deliberately ignored it. Not seldom Philip, knowing all the time how stupid he
was, would force a quarrel, and they would not speak to one another for a
couple of days. But Philip could not bear to be angry with him long, and even
when convinced that he was in the right, would apologise humbly. Then for a
week they would be as great friends as ever. But the best was over, and Philip
could see that Rose often walked with him merely from old habit or from fear of
his anger; they had not so much to say to one another as at first, and Rose was
often bored. Philip felt that his lameness began to irritate him.
</p>

<p>
Towards the end of the term two or three boys caught scarlet fever, and there
was much talk of sending them all home in order to escape an epidemic; but the
sufferers were isolated, and since no more were attacked it was supposed that
the outbreak was stopped. One of the stricken was Philip. He remained in
hospital through the Easter holidays, and at the beginning of the summer term
was sent home to the vicarage to get a little fresh air. The Vicar,
notwithstanding medical assurance that the boy was no longer infectious,
received him with suspicion; he thought it very inconsiderate of the doctor to
suggest that his nephew&rsquo;s convalescence should be spent by the seaside,
and consented to have him in the house only because there was nowhere else he
could go.
</p>

<p>
Philip went back to school at half-term. He had forgotten the quarrels he had
had with Rose, but remembered only that he was his greatest friend. He knew
that he had been silly. He made up his mind to be more reasonable. During his
illness Rose had sent him in a couple of little notes, and he had ended each
with the words: &ldquo;Hurry up and come back.&rdquo; Philip thought Rose must
be looking forward as much to his return as he was himself to seeing Rose.
</p>

<p>
He found that owing to the death from scarlet fever of one of the boys in the
Sixth there had been some shifting in the studies and Rose was no longer in
his. It was a bitter disappointment. But as soon as he arrived he burst into
Rose&rsquo;s study. Rose was sitting at his desk, working with a boy called
Hunter, and turned round crossly as Philip came in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who the devil&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he cried. And then, seeing Philip:
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip stopped in embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d come in and see how you were.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We were just working.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hunter broke into the conversation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When did you get back?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Five minutes ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They sat and looked at him as though he was disturbing them. They evidently
expected him to go quickly. Philip reddened.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be off. You might look in when you&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; he
said to Rose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip closed the door behind him and limped back to his own study. He felt
frightfully hurt. Rose, far from seeming glad to see him, had looked almost put
out. They might never have been more than acquaintances. Though he waited in
his study, not leaving it for a moment in case just then Rose should come, his
friend never appeared; and next morning when he went in to prayers he saw Rose
and Hunter singing along arm in arm. What he could not see for himself others
told him. He had forgotten that three months is a long time in a
schoolboy&rsquo;s life, and though he had passed them in solitude Rose had
lived in the world. Hunter had stepped into the vacant place. Philip found that
Rose was quietly avoiding him. But he was not the boy to accept a situation
without putting it into words; he waited till he was sure Rose was alone in his
study and went in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
Rose looked at him with an embarrassment that made him angry with Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, if you want to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you,&rdquo; said Philip sarcastically.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you want?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, why have you been so rotten since I came back?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be an ass,&rdquo; said Rose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you see in Hunter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my business.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip looked down. He could not bring himself to say what was in his heart. He
was afraid of humiliating himself. Rose got up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go to the Gym,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
When he was at the door Philip forced himself to speak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, Rose, don&rsquo;t be a perfect beast.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, go to hell.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Rose slammed the door behind him and left Philip alone. Philip shivered with
rage. He went back to his study and turned the conversation over in his mind.
He hated Rose now, he wanted to hurt him, he thought of biting things he might
have said to him. He brooded over the end to their friendship and fancied that
others were talking of it. In his sensitiveness he saw sneers and wonderings in
other fellows&rsquo; manner when they were not bothering their heads with him
at all. He imagined to himself what they were saying.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;After all, it wasn&rsquo;t likely to last long. I wonder he ever stuck
Carey at all. Blighter!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
To show his indifference he struck up a violent friendship with a boy called
Sharp whom he hated and despised. He was a London boy, with a loutish air, a
heavy fellow with the beginnings of a moustache on his lip and bushy eyebrows
that joined one another across the bridge of his nose. He had soft hands and
manners too suave for his years. He spoke with the suspicion of a cockney
accent. He was one of those boys who are too slack to play games, and he
exercised great ingenuity in making excuses to avoid such as were compulsory.
He was regarded by boys and masters with a vague dislike, and it was from
arrogance that Philip now sought his society. Sharp in a couple of terms was
going to Germany for a year. He hated school, which he looked upon as an
indignity to be endured till he was old enough to go out into the world. London
was all he cared for, and he had many stories to tell of his doings there
during the holidays. From his conversation&mdash;he spoke in a soft, deep-toned
voice&mdash;there emerged the vague rumour of the London streets by night.
Philip listened to him at once fascinated and repelled. With his vivid fancy he
seemed to see the surging throng round the pit-door of theatres, and the
glitter of cheap restaurants, bars where men, half drunk, sat on high stools
talking with barmaids; and under the street lamps the mysterious passing of
dark crowds bent upon pleasure. Sharp lent him cheap novels from Holywell Row,
which Philip read in his cubicle with a sort of wonderful fear.
</p>

<p>
Once Rose tried to effect a reconciliation. He was a good-natured fellow, who
did not like having enemies.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, Carey, why are you being such a silly ass? It doesn&rsquo;t do
you any good cutting me and all that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; answered Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see why you shouldn&rsquo;t talk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You bore me,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Please yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Rose shrugged his shoulders and left him. Philip was very white, as he always
became when he was moved, and his heart beat violently. When Rose went away he
felt suddenly sick with misery. He did not know why he had answered in that
fashion. He would have given anything to be friends with Rose. He hated to have
quarrelled with him, and now that he saw he had given him pain he was very
sorry. But at the moment he had not been master of himself. It seemed that some
devil had seized him, forcing him to say bitter things against his will, even
though at the time he wanted to shake hands with Rose and meet him more than
halfway. The desire to wound had been too strong for him. He had wanted to
revenge himself for the pain and the humiliation he had endured. It was pride:
it was folly too, for he knew that Rose would not care at all, while he would
suffer bitterly. The thought came to him that he would go to Rose, and say:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, I&rsquo;m sorry I was such a beast. I couldn&rsquo;t help it.
Let&rsquo;s make it up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But he knew he would never be able to do it. He was afraid that Rose would
sneer at him. He was angry with himself, and when Sharp came in a little while
afterwards he seized upon the first opportunity to quarrel with him. Philip had
a fiendish instinct for discovering other people&rsquo;s raw spots, and was
able to say things that rankled because they were true. But Sharp had the last
word.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I heard Rose talking about you to Mellor just now,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Mellor said: Why didn&rsquo;t you kick him? It would teach him manners.
And Rose said: I didn&rsquo;t like to. Damned cripple.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip suddenly became scarlet. He could not answer, for there was a lump in
his throat that almost choked him.
</p>

<h2>XX</h2>

<p>
Philip was moved into the Sixth, but he hated school now with all his heart,
and, having lost his ambition, cared nothing whether he did ill or well. He
awoke in the morning with a sinking heart because he must go through another
day of drudgery. He was tired of having to do things because he was told; and
the restrictions irked him, not because they were unreasonable, but because
they were restrictions. He yearned for freedom. He was weary of repeating
things that he knew already and of the hammering away, for the sake of a
thick-witted fellow, at something that he understood from the beginning.
</p>

<p>
With Mr. Perkins you could work or not as you chose. He was at once eager and
abstracted. The Sixth Form room was in a part of the old abbey which had been
restored, and it had a gothic window: Philip tried to cheat his boredom by
drawing this over and over again; and sometimes out of his head he drew the
great tower of the Cathedral or the gateway that led into the precincts. He had
a knack for drawing. Aunt Louisa during her youth had painted in water colours,
and she had several albums filled with sketches of churches, old bridges, and
picturesque cottages. They were often shown at the vicarage tea-parties. She
had once given Philip a paint-box as a Christmas present, and he had started by
copying her pictures. He copied them better than anyone could have expected,
and presently he did little pictures of his own. Mrs. Carey encouraged him. It
was a good way to keep him out of mischief, and later on his sketches would be
useful for bazaars. Two or three of them had been framed and hung in his
bed-room.
</p>

<p>
But one day, at the end of the morning&rsquo;s work, Mr. Perkins stopped him as
he was lounging out of the form-room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want to speak to you, Carey.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip waited. Mr. Perkins ran his lean fingers through his beard and looked at
Philip. He seemed to be thinking over what he wanted to say.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you, Carey?&rdquo; he said abruptly.
</p>

<p>
Philip, flushing, looked at him quickly. But knowing him well by now, without
answering, he waited for him to go on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been dissatisfied with you lately. You&rsquo;ve been slack
and inattentive. You seem to take no interest in your work. It&rsquo;s been
slovenly and bad.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry, sir,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that all you have to say for yourself?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip looked down sulkily. How could he answer that he was bored to death?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know, this term you&rsquo;ll go down instead of up. I shan&rsquo;t
give you a very good report.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip wondered what he would say if he knew how the report was treated. It
arrived at breakfast, Mr. Carey glanced at it indifferently, and passed it over
to Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your report. You&rsquo;d better see what it says,&rdquo;
he remarked, as he ran his fingers through the wrapper of a catalogue of
second-hand books.
</p>

<p>
Philip read it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it good?&rdquo; asked Aunt Louisa.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not so good as I deserve,&rdquo; answered Philip, with a smile, giving
it to her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll read it afterwards when I&rsquo;ve got my spectacles,&rdquo;
she said.
</p>

<p>
But after breakfast Mary Ann came in to say the butcher was there, and she
generally forgot.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Perkins went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m disappointed with you. And I can&rsquo;t understand. I know
you can do things if you want to, but you don&rsquo;t seem to want to any more.
I was going to make you a monitor next term, but I think I&rsquo;d better wait
a bit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip flushed. He did not like the thought of being passed over. He tightened
his lips.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s something else. You must begin thinking of your
scholarship now. You won&rsquo;t get anything unless you start working very
seriously.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was irritated by the lecture. He was angry with the headmaster, and
angry with himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going up to Oxford,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not? I thought your idea was to be ordained.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve changed my mind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip did not answer. Mr. Perkins, holding himself oddly as he always did,
like a figure in one of Perugino&rsquo;s pictures, drew his fingers
thoughtfully through his beard. He looked at Philip as though he were trying to
understand and then abruptly told him he might go.
</p>

<p>
Apparently he was not satisfied, for one evening, a week later, when Philip had
to go into his study with some papers, he resumed the conversation; but this
time he adopted a different method: he spoke to Philip not as a schoolmaster
with a boy but as one human being with another. He did not seem to care now
that Philip&rsquo;s work was poor, that he ran small chance against keen rivals
of carrying off the scholarship necessary for him to go to Oxford: the
important matter was his changed intention about his life afterwards. Mr.
Perkins set himself to revive his eagerness to be ordained. With infinite skill
he worked on his feelings, and this was easier since he was himself genuinely
moved. Philip&rsquo;s change of mind caused him bitter distress, and he really
thought he was throwing away his chance of happiness in life for he knew not
what. His voice was very persuasive. And Philip, easily moved by the emotion of
others, very emotional himself notwithstanding a placid exterior&mdash;his
face, partly by nature but also from the habit of all these years at school,
seldom except by his quick flushing showed what he felt&mdash;Philip was deeply
touched by what the master said. He was very grateful to him for the interest
he showed, and he was conscience-stricken by the grief which he felt his
behaviour caused him. It was subtly flattering to know that with the whole
school to think about Mr. Perkins should trouble with him, but at the same time
something else in him, like another person standing at his elbow, clung
desperately to two words.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t. I won&rsquo;t. I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He felt himself slipping. He was powerless against the weakness that seemed to
well up in him; it was like the water that rises up in an empty bottle held
over a full basin; and he set his teeth, saying the words over and over to
himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t. I won&rsquo;t. I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At last Mr. Perkins put his hand on Philip&rsquo;s shoulder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to influence you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You must
decide for yourself. Pray to Almighty God for help and guidance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When Philip came out of the headmaster&rsquo;s house there was a light rain
falling. He went under the archway that led to the precincts, there was not a
soul there, and the rooks were silent in the elms. He walked round slowly. He
felt hot, and the rain did him good. He thought over all that Mr. Perkins had
said, calmly now that he was withdrawn from the fervour of his personality, and
he was thankful he had not given way.
</p>

<p>
In the darkness he could but vaguely see the great mass of the Cathedral: he
hated it now because of the irksomeness of the long services which he was
forced to attend. The anthem was interminable, and you had to stand drearily
while it was being sung; you could not hear the droning sermon, and your body
twitched because you had to sit still when you wanted to move about. Then
Philip thought of the two services every Sunday at Blackstable. The church was
bare and cold, and there was a smell all about one of pomade and starched
clothes. The curate preached once and his uncle preached once. As he grew up he
had learned to know his uncle; Philip was downright and intolerant, and he
could not understand that a man might sincerely say things as a clergyman which
he never acted up to as a man. The deception outraged him. His uncle was a weak
and selfish man, whose chief desire it was to be saved trouble.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Perkins had spoken to him of the beauty of a life dedicated to the service
of God. Philip knew what sort of lives the clergy led in the corner of East
Anglia which was his home. There was the Vicar of Whitestone, a parish a little
way from Blackstable: he was a bachelor and to give himself something to do had
lately taken up farming: the local paper constantly reported the cases he had
in the county court against this one and that, labourers he would not pay their
wages to or tradesmen whom he accused of cheating him; scandal said he starved
his cows, and there was much talk about some general action which should be
taken against him. Then there was the Vicar of Ferne, a bearded, fine figure of
a man: his wife had been forced to leave him because of his cruelty, and she
had filled the neighbourhood with stories of his immorality. The Vicar of
Surle, a tiny hamlet by the sea, was to be seen every evening in the public
house a stone&rsquo;s throw from his vicarage; and the churchwardens had been
to Mr. Carey to ask his advice. There was not a soul for any of them to talk to
except small farmers or fishermen; there were long winter evenings when the
wind blew, whistling drearily through the leafless trees, and all around they
saw nothing but the bare monotony of ploughed fields; and there was poverty,
and there was lack of any work that seemed to matter; every kink in their
characters had free play; there was nothing to restrain them; they grew narrow
and eccentric: Philip knew all this, but in his young intolerance he did not
offer it as an excuse. He shivered at the thought of leading such a life; he
wanted to get out into the world.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">

<h2>XXI</h2>

<p>
Mr. Perkins soon saw that his words had had no effect on Philip, and for the
rest of the term ignored him. He wrote a report which was vitriolic. When it
arrived and Aunt Louisa asked Philip what it was like, he answered cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rotten.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; said the Vicar. &ldquo;I must look at it again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you think there&rsquo;s any use in my staying on at Tercanbury? I
should have thought it would be better if I went to Germany for a bit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What has put that in your head?&rdquo; said Aunt Louisa.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s rather a good idea?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sharp had already left King&rsquo;s School and had written to Philip from
Hanover. He was really starting life, and it made Philip more restless to think
of it. He felt he could not bear another year of restraint.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But then you wouldn&rsquo;t get a scholarship.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a chance of getting one anyhow. And besides, I
don&rsquo;t know that I particularly want to go to Oxford.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But if you&rsquo;re going to be ordained, Philip?&rdquo; Aunt Louisa
exclaimed in dismay.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given up that idea long ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Carey looked at him with startled eyes, and then, used to self-restraint,
she poured out another cup of tea for his uncle. They did not speak. In a
moment Philip saw tears slowly falling down her cheeks. His heart was suddenly
wrung because he caused her pain. In her tight black dress, made by the
dressmaker down the street, with her wrinkled face and pale tired eyes, her
gray hair still done in the frivolous ringlets of her youth, she was a
ridiculous but strangely pathetic figure. Philip saw it for the first time.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards, when the Vicar was shut up in his study with the curate, he put his
arms round her waist.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re upset, Aunt Louisa,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s no good my being ordained if I haven&rsquo;t a real
vocation, is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so disappointed, Philip,&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
set my heart on it. I thought you could be your uncle&rsquo;s curate, and then
when our time came&mdash;after all, we can&rsquo;t last for ever, can
we?&mdash;you might have taken his place.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip shivered. He was seized with panic. His heart beat like a pigeon in a
trap beating with its wings. His aunt wept softly, her head upon his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d persuade Uncle William to let me leave Tercanbury.
I&rsquo;m so sick of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But the Vicar of Blackstable did not easily alter any arrangements he had made,
and it had always been intended that Philip should stay at King&rsquo;s School
till he was eighteen, and should then go to Oxford. At all events he would not
hear of Philip leaving then, for no notice had been given and the term&rsquo;s
fee would have to be paid in any case.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then will you give notice for me to leave at Christmas?&rdquo; said
Philip, at the end of a long and often bitter conversation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write to Mr. Perkins about it and see what he says.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I wish to goodness I were twenty-one. It is awful to be at somebody
else&rsquo;s beck and call.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Philip, you shouldn&rsquo;t speak to your uncle like that,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Carey gently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you see that Perkins will want me to stay? He gets so
much a head for every chap in the school.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you want to go to Oxford?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good if I&rsquo;m not going into the Church?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go into the Church: you&rsquo;re in the Church
already,&rdquo; said the Vicar.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ordained then,&rdquo; replied Philip impatiently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you going to be, Philip?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Carey.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ve not made up my mind. But whatever I am,
it&rsquo;ll be useful to know foreign languages. I shall get far more out of a
year in Germany than by staying on at that hole.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He would not say that he felt Oxford would be little better than a continuation
of his life at school. He wished immensely to be his own master. Besides he
would be known to a certain extent among old schoolfellows, and he wanted to
get away from them all. He felt that his life at school had been a failure. He
wanted to start fresh.
</p>

<p>
It happened that his desire to go to Germany fell in with certain ideas which
had been of late discussed at Blackstable. Sometimes friends came to stay with
the doctor and brought news of the world outside; and the visitors spending
August by the sea had their own way of looking at things. The Vicar had heard
that there were people who did not think the old-fashioned education so useful
nowadays as it had been in the past, and modern languages were gaining an
importance which they had not had in his own youth. His own mind was divided,
for a younger brother of his had been sent to Germany when he failed in some
examination, thus creating a precedent but since he had there died of typhoid
it was impossible to look upon the experiment as other than dangerous. The
result of innumerable conversations was that Philip should go back to
Tercanbury for another term, and then should leave. With this agreement Philip
was not dissatisfied. But when he had been back a few days the headmaster spoke
to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a letter from your uncle. It appears you want to go to
Germany, and he asks me what I think about it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was astounded. He was furious with his guardian for going back on his
word.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought it was settled, sir,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Far from it. I&rsquo;ve written to say I think it the greatest mistake
to take you away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip immediately sat down and wrote a violent letter to his uncle. He did not
measure his language. He was so angry that he could not get to sleep till quite
late that night, and he awoke in the early morning and began brooding over the
way they had treated him. He waited impatiently for an answer. In two or three
days it came. It was a mild, pained letter from Aunt Louisa, saying that he
should not write such things to his uncle, who was very much distressed. He was
unkind and unchristian. He must know they were only trying to do their best for
him, and they were so much older than he that they must be better judges of
what was good for him. Philip clenched his hands. He had heard that statement
so often, and he could not see why it was true; they did not know the
conditions as he did, why should they accept it as self-evident that their
greater age gave them greater wisdom? The letter ended with the information
that Mr. Carey had withdrawn the notice he had given.
</p>

<p>
Philip nursed his wrath till the next half-holiday. They had them on Tuesdays
and Thursdays, since on Saturday afternoons they had to go to a service in the
Cathedral. He stopped behind when the rest of the Sixth went out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;May I go to Blackstable this afternoon, please, sir?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the headmaster briefly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wanted to see my uncle about something very important.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear me say no?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip did not answer. He went out. He felt almost sick with humiliation, the
humiliation of having to ask and the humiliation of the curt refusal. He hated
the headmaster now. Philip writhed under that despotism which never vouchsafed
a reason for the most tyrannous act. He was too angry to care what he did, and
after dinner walked down to the station, by the back ways he knew so well, just
in time to catch the train to Blackstable. He walked into the vicarage and
found his uncle and aunt sitting in the dining-room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hulloa, where have you sprung from?&rdquo; said the Vicar.
</p>

<p>
It was very clear that he was not pleased to see him. He looked a little
uneasy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d come and see you about my leaving. I want to know
what you mean by promising me one thing when I was here, and doing something
different a week after.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was a little frightened at his own boldness, but he had made up his mind
exactly what words to use, and, though his heart beat violently, he forced
himself to say them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you got leave to come here this afternoon?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. I asked Perkins and he refused. If you like to write and tell him
I&rsquo;ve been here you can get me into a really fine old row.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Carey sat knitting with trembling hands. She was unused to scenes and they
agitated her extremely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It would serve you right if I told him,&rdquo; said Mr. Carey.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you like to be a perfect sneak you can. After writing to Perkins as
you did you&rsquo;re quite capable of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was foolish of Philip to say that, because it gave the Vicar exactly the
opportunity he wanted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to sit still while you say impertinent things to
me,&rdquo; he said with dignity.
</p>

<p>
He got up and walked quickly out of the room into his study. Philip heard him
shut the door and lock it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I wish to God I were twenty-one. It is awful to be tied down like
this.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Aunt Louisa began to cry quietly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Philip, you oughtn&rsquo;t to have spoken to your uncle like that.
Do please go and tell him you&rsquo;re sorry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in the least sorry. He&rsquo;s taking a mean advantage. Of
course it&rsquo;s just waste of money keeping me on at school, but what does he
care? It&rsquo;s not his money. It was cruel to put me under the guardianship
of people who know nothing about things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Philip.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip in his voluble anger stopped suddenly at the sound of her voice. It was
heart-broken. He had not realised what bitter things he was saying.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Philip, how can you be so unkind? You know we are only trying to do our
best for you, and we know that we have no experience; it isn&rsquo;t as if
we&rsquo;d had any children of our own: that&rsquo;s why we consulted Mr.
Perkins.&rdquo; Her voice broke. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried to be like a mother to
you. I&rsquo;ve loved you as if you were my own son.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She was so small and frail, there was something so pathetic in her old-maidish
air, that Philip was touched. A great lump came suddenly in his throat and his
eyes filled with tears.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to be
beastly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He knelt down beside her and took her in his arms, and kissed her wet, withered
cheeks. She sobbed bitterly, and he seemed to feel on a sudden the pity of that
wasted life. She had never surrendered herself before to such a display of
emotion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;ve not been what I wanted to be to you, Philip, but I
didn&rsquo;t know how. It&rsquo;s been just as dreadful for me to have no
children as for you to have no mother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip forgot his anger and his own concerns, but thought only of consoling
her, with broken words and clumsy little caresses. Then the clock struck, and
he had to bolt off at once to catch the only train that would get him back to
Tercanbury in time for call-over. As he sat in the corner of the railway
carriage he saw that he had done nothing. He was angry with himself for his
weakness. It was despicable to have allowed himself to be turned from his
purpose by the pompous airs of the Vicar and the tears of his aunt. But as the
result of he knew not what conversations between the couple another letter was
written to the headmaster. Mr. Perkins read it with an impatient shrug of the
shoulders. He showed it to Philip. It ran:
</p>

<p>
Dear Mr. Perkins,
</p>

<p>
Forgive me for troubling you again about my ward, but both his Aunt and I have
been uneasy about him. He seems very anxious to leave school, and his Aunt
thinks he is unhappy. It is very difficult for us to know what to do as we are
not his parents. He does not seem to think he is doing very well and he feels
it is wasting his money to stay on. I should be very much obliged if you would
have a talk to him, and if he is still of the same mind perhaps it would be
better if he left at Christmas as I originally intended.
</p>

<p>
Yours very truly,<br/>
  William Carey.
</p>

<p>
Philip gave him back the letter. He felt a thrill of pride in his triumph. He
had got his own way, and he was satisfied. His will had gained a victory over
the wills of others.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not much good my spending half an hour writing to your uncle
if he changes his mind the next letter he gets from you,&rdquo; said the
headmaster irritably.
</p>

<p>
Philip said nothing, and his face was perfectly placid; but he could not
prevent the twinkle in his eyes. Mr. Perkins noticed it and broke into a little
laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve rather scored, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
Then Philip smiled outright. He could not conceal his exultation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it true that you&rsquo;re very anxious to leave?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you unhappy here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip blushed. He hated instinctively any attempt to get into the depths of
his feelings.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Perkins, slowly dragging his fingers through his beard, looked at him
thoughtfully. He seemed to speak almost to himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course schools are made for the average. The holes are all round, and
whatever shape the pegs are they must wedge in somehow. One hasn&rsquo;t time
to bother about anything but the average.&rdquo; Then suddenly he addressed
himself to Philip: &ldquo;Look here, I&rsquo;ve got a suggestion to make to
you. It&rsquo;s getting on towards the end of the term now. Another term
won&rsquo;t kill you, and if you want to go to Germany you&rsquo;d better go
after Easter than after Christmas. It&rsquo;ll be much pleasanter in the spring
than in midwinter. If at the end of the next term you still want to go
I&rsquo;ll make no objection. What d&rsquo;you say to that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you very much, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was so glad to have gained the last three months that he did not mind
the extra term. The school seemed less of a prison when he knew that before
Easter he would be free from it for ever. His heart danced within him. That
evening in chapel he looked round at the boys, standing according to their
forms, each in his due place, and he chuckled with satisfaction at the thought
that soon he would never see them again. It made him regard them almost with a
friendly feeling. His eyes rested on Rose. Rose took his position as a monitor
very seriously: he had quite an idea of being a good influence in the school;
it was his turn to read the lesson that evening, and he read it very well.
Philip smiled when he thought that he would be rid of him for ever, and it
would not matter in six months whether Rose was tall and straight-limbed; and
where would the importance be that he was a monitor and captain of the eleven?
Philip looked at the masters in their gowns. Gordon was dead, he had died of
apoplexy two years before, but all the rest were there. Philip knew now what a
poor lot they were, except Turner perhaps, there was something of a man in him;
and he writhed at the thought of the subjection in which they had held him. In
six months they would not matter either. Their praise would mean nothing to
him, and he would shrug his shoulders at their censure.
</p>

<p>
Philip had learned not to express his emotions by outward signs, and shyness
still tormented him, but he had often very high spirits; and then, though he
limped about demurely, silent and reserved, it seemed to be hallooing in his
heart. He seemed to himself to walk more lightly. All sorts of ideas danced
through his head, fancies chased one another so furiously that he could not
catch them; but their coming and their going filled him with exhilaration. Now,
being happy, he was able to work, and during the remaining weeks of the term
set himself to make up for his long neglect. His brain worked easily, and he
took a keen pleasure in the activity of his intellect. He did very well in the
examinations that closed the term. Mr. Perkins made only one remark: he was
talking to him about an essay he had written, and, after the usual criticisms,
said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve made up your mind to stop playing the fool for a bit,
have you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He smiled at him with his shining teeth, and Philip, looking down, gave an
embarrassed smile.
</p>

<p>
The half dozen boys who expected to divide between them the various prizes
which were given at the end of the summer term had ceased to look upon Philip
as a serious rival, but now they began to regard him with some uneasiness. He
told no one that he was leaving at Easter and so was in no sense a competitor,
but left them to their anxieties. He knew that Rose flattered himself on his
French, for he had spent two or three holidays in France; and he expected to
get the Dean&rsquo;s Prize for English essay; Philip got a good deal of
satisfaction in watching his dismay when he saw how much better Philip was
doing in these subjects than himself. Another fellow, Norton, could not go to
Oxford unless he got one of the scholarships at the disposal of the school. He
asked Philip if he was going in for them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you any objection?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
It entertained him to think that he held someone else&rsquo;s future in his
hand. There was something romantic in getting these various rewards actually in
his grasp, and then leaving them to others because he disdained them. At last
the breaking-up day came, and he went to Mr. Perkins to bid him good-bye.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you really want to leave?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
 Philip&rsquo;s face fell at the headmaster&rsquo;s evident surprise.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You said you wouldn&rsquo;t put any objection in the way, sir,&rdquo; he
answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought it was only a whim that I&rsquo;d better humour. I know
you&rsquo;re obstinate and headstrong. What on earth d&rsquo;you want to leave
for now? You&rsquo;ve only got another term in any case. You can get the
Magdalen scholarship easily; you&rsquo;ll get half the prizes we&rsquo;ve got
to give.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip looked at him sullenly. He felt that he had been tricked; but he had the
promise, and Perkins would have to stand by it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a very pleasant time at Oxford. You needn&rsquo;t
decide at once what you&rsquo;re going to do afterwards. I wonder if you
realise how delightful the life is up there for anyone who has brains.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made all my arrangements now to go to Germany, sir,&rdquo;
said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are they arrangements that couldn&rsquo;t possibly be altered?&rdquo;
asked Mr. Perkins, with his quizzical smile. &ldquo;I shall be very sorry to
lose you. In schools the rather stupid boys who work always do better than the
clever boy who&rsquo;s idle, but when the clever boy works&mdash;why then, he
does what you&rsquo;ve done this term.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip flushed darkly. He was unused to compliments, and no one had ever told
him he was clever. The headmaster put his hand on Philip&rsquo;s shoulder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know, driving things into the heads of thick-witted boys is dull
work, but when now and then you have the chance of teaching a boy who comes
half-way towards you, who understands almost before you&rsquo;ve got the words
out of your mouth, why, then teaching is the most exhilarating thing in the
world.&rdquo; Philip was melted by kindness; it had never occurred to him that
it mattered really to Mr. Perkins whether he went or stayed. He was touched and
immensely flattered. It would be pleasant to end up his school-days with glory
and then go to Oxford: in a flash there appeared before him the life which he
had heard described from boys who came back to play in the O.K.S. match or in
letters from the University read out in one of the studies. But he was ashamed;
he would look such a fool in his own eyes if he gave in now; his uncle would
chuckle at the success of the headmaster&rsquo;s ruse. It was rather a
come-down from the dramatic surrender of all these prizes which were in his
reach, because he disdained to take them, to the plain, ordinary winning of
them. It only required a little more persuasion, just enough to save his
self-respect, and Philip would have done anything that Mr. Perkins wished; but
his face showed nothing of his conflicting emotions. It was placid and sullen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d rather go, sir,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Perkins, like many men who manage things by their personal influence, grew
a little impatient when his power was not immediately manifest. He had a great
deal of work to do, and could not waste more time on a boy who seemed to him
insanely obstinate.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well, I promised to let you if you really wanted it, and I keep my
promise. When do you go to Germany?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip&rsquo;s heart beat violently. The battle was won, and he did not know
whether he had not rather lost it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At the beginning of May, sir,&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you must come and see us when you get back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He held out his hand. If he had given him one more chance Philip would have
changed his mind, but he seemed to look upon the matter as settled. Philip
walked out of the house. His school-days were over, and he was free; but the
wild exultation to which he had looked forward at that moment was not there. He
walked round the precincts slowly, and a profound depression seized him. He
wished now that he had not been foolish. He did not want to go, but he knew he
could never bring himself to go to the headmaster and tell him he would stay.
That was a humiliation he could never put upon himself. He wondered whether he
had done right. He was dissatisfied with himself and with all his
circumstances. He asked himself dully whether whenever you got your way you
wished afterwards that you hadn&rsquo;t.

<h2>XXII</h2>

<p>
Philip&rsquo;s uncle had an old friend, called Miss Wilkinson, who lived in
Berlin. She was the daughter of a clergyman, and it was with her father, the
rector of a village in Lincolnshire, that Mr. Carey had spent his last curacy;
on his death, forced to earn her living, she had taken various situations as a
governess in France and Germany. She had kept up a correspondence with Mrs.
Carey, and two or three times had spent her holidays at Blackstable Vicarage,
paying as was usual with the Careys&rsquo; unfrequent guests a small sum for
her keep. When it became clear that it was less trouble to yield to
Philip&rsquo;s wishes than to resist them, Mrs. Carey wrote to ask her for
advice. Miss Wilkinson recommended Heidelberg as an excellent place to learn
German in and the house of Frau Professor Erlin as a comfortable home. Philip
might live there for thirty marks a week, and the Professor himself, a teacher
at the local high school, would instruct him.
</p>

<p>
Philip arrived in Heidelberg one morning in May. His things were put on a
barrow and he followed the porter out of the station. The sky was bright blue,
and the trees in the avenue through which they passed were thick with leaves;
there was something in the air fresh to Philip, and mingled with the timidity
he felt at entering on a new life, among strangers, was a great exhilaration.
He was a little disconsolate that no one had come to meet him, and felt very
shy when the porter left him at the front door of a big white house. An untidy
lad let him in and took him into a drawing-room. It was filled with a large
suite covered in green velvet, and in the middle was a round table. On this in
water stood a bouquet of flowers tightly packed together in a paper frill like
the bone of a mutton chop, and carefully spaced round it were books in leather
bindings. There was a musty smell.
</p>

<p>
Presently, with an odour of cooking, the Frau Professor came in, a short, very
stout woman with tightly dressed hair and a red face; she had little eyes,
sparkling like beads, and an effusive manner. She took both Philip&rsquo;s
hands and asked him about Miss Wilkinson, who had twice spent a few weeks with
her. She spoke in German and in broken English. Philip could not make her
understand that he did not know Miss Wilkinson. Then her two daughters
appeared. They seemed hardly young to Philip, but perhaps they were not more
than twenty-five: the elder, Thekla, was as short as her mother, with the same,
rather shifty air, but with a pretty face and abundant dark hair; Anna, her
younger sister, was tall and plain, but since she had a pleasant smile Philip
immediately preferred her. After a few minutes of polite conversation the Frau
Professor took Philip to his room and left him. It was in a turret, looking
over the tops of the trees in the Anlage; and the bed was in an alcove, so that
when you sat at the desk it had not the look of a bed-room at all. Philip
unpacked his things and set out all his books. He was his own master at last.
</p>

<p>
A bell summoned him to dinner at one o&rsquo;clock, and he found the Frau
Professor&rsquo;s guests assembled in the drawing-room. He was introduced to
her husband, a tall man of middle age with a large fair head, turning now to
gray, and mild blue eyes. He spoke to Philip in correct, rather archaic
English, having learned it from a study of the English classics, not from
conversation; and it was odd to hear him use words colloquially which Philip
had only met in the plays of Shakespeare. Frau Professor Erlin called her
establishment a family and not a pension; but it would have required the
subtlety of a metaphysician to find out exactly where the difference lay. When
they sat down to dinner in a long dark apartment that led out of the
drawing-room, Philip, feeling very shy, saw that there were sixteen people. The
Frau Professor sat at one end and carved. The service was conducted, with a
great clattering of plates, by the same clumsy lout who had opened the door for
him; and though he was quick it happened that the first persons to be served
had finished before the last had received their appointed portions. The Frau
Professor insisted that nothing but German should be spoken, so that Philip,
even if his bashfulness had permitted him to be talkative, was forced to hold
his tongue. He looked at the people among whom he was to live. By the Frau
Professor sat several old ladies, but Philip did not give them much of his
attention. There were two young girls, both fair and one of them very pretty,
whom Philip heard addressed as Fraulein Hedwig and Fraulein Cacilie. Fraulein
Cacilie had a long pig-tail hanging down her back. They sat side by side and
chattered to one another, with smothered laughter: now and then they glanced at
Philip and one of them said something in an undertone; they both giggled, and
Philip blushed awkwardly, feeling that they were making fun of him. Near them
sat a Chinaman, with a yellow face and an expansive smile, who was studying
Western conditions at the University. He spoke so quickly, with a queer accent,
that the girls could not always understand him, and then they burst out
laughing. He laughed too, good-humouredly, and his almond eyes almost closed as
he did so. There were two or three American men, in black coats, rather yellow
and dry of skin: they were theological students; Philip heard the twang of
their New England accent through their bad German, and he glanced at them with
suspicion; for he had been taught to look upon Americans as wild and desperate
barbarians.
</p>

<p>
Afterwards, when they had sat for a little on the stiff green velvet chairs of
the drawing-room, Fraulein Anna asked Philip if he would like to go for a walk
with them.
</p>

<p>
Philip accepted the invitation. They were quite a party. There were the two
daughters of the Frau Professor, the two other girls, one of the American
students, and Philip. Philip walked by the side of Anna and Fraulein Hedwig. He
was a little fluttered. He had never known any girls. At Blackstable there were
only the farmers&rsquo; daughters and the girls of the local tradesmen. He knew
them by name and by sight, but he was timid, and he thought they laughed at his
deformity. He accepted willingly the difference which the Vicar and Mrs. Carey
put between their own exalted rank and that of the farmers. The doctor had two
daughters, but they were both much older than Philip and had been married to
successive assistants while Philip was still a small boy. At school there had
been two or three girls of more boldness than modesty whom some of the boys
knew; and desperate stories, due in all probability to the masculine
imagination, were told of intrigues with them; but Philip had always concealed
under a lofty contempt the terror with which they filled him. His imagination
and the books he had read had inspired in him a desire for the Byronic
attitude; and he was torn between a morbid self-consciousness and a conviction
that he owed it to himself to be gallant. He felt now that he should be bright
and amusing, but his brain seemed empty and he could not for the life of him
think of anything to say. Fraulein Anna, the Frau Professor&rsquo;s daughter,
addressed herself to him frequently from a sense of duty, but the other said
little: she looked at him now and then with sparkling eyes, and sometimes to
his confusion laughed outright. Philip felt that she thought him perfectly
ridiculous. They walked along the side of a hill among pine-trees, and their
pleasant odour caused Philip a keen delight. The day was warm and cloudless. At
last they came to an eminence from which they saw the valley of the Rhine
spread out before them under the sun. It was a vast stretch of country,
sparkling with golden light, with cities in the distance; and through it
meandered the silver ribband of the river. Wide spaces are rare in the corner
of Kent which Philip knew, the sea offers the only broad horizon, and the
immense distance he saw now gave him a peculiar, an indescribable thrill. He
felt suddenly elated. Though he did not know it, it was the first time that he
had experienced, quite undiluted with foreign emotions, the sense of beauty.
They sat on a bench, the three of them, for the others had gone on, and while
the girls talked in rapid German, Philip, indifferent to their proximity,
feasted his eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove, I am happy,&rdquo; he said to himself unconsciously.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">

<h2>XXIII</h2>

<p>
Philip thought occasionally of the King&rsquo;s School at Tercanbury, and
laughed to himself as he remembered what at some particular moment of the day
they were doing. Now and then he dreamed that he was there still, and it gave
him an extraordinary satisfaction, on awaking, to realise that he was in his
little room in the turret. From his bed he could see the great cumulus clouds
that hung in the blue sky. He revelled in his freedom. He could go to bed when
he chose and get up when the fancy took him. There was no one to order him
about. It struck him that he need not tell any more lies.
</p>

<p>
It had been arranged that Professor Erlin should teach him Latin and German; a
Frenchman came every day to give him lessons in French; and the Frau Professor
had recommended for mathematics an Englishman who was taking a philological
degree at the university. This was a man named Wharton. Philip went to him
every morning. He lived in one room on the top floor of a shabby house. It was
dirty and untidy, and it was filled with a pungent odour made up of many
different stinks. He was generally in bed when Philip arrived at ten
o&rsquo;clock, and he jumped out, put on a filthy dressing-gown and felt
slippers, and, while he gave instruction, ate his simple breakfast. He was a
short man, stout from excessive beer drinking, with a heavy moustache and long,
unkempt hair. He had been in Germany for five years and was become very
Teutonic. He spoke with scorn of Cambridge where he had taken his degree and
with horror of the life which awaited him when, having taken his doctorate in
Heidelberg, he must return to England and a pedagogic career. He adored the
life of the German university with its happy freedom and its jolly
companionships. He was a member of a Burschenschaft, and promised to take
Philip to a Kneipe. He was very poor and made no secret that the lessons he was
giving Philip meant the difference between meat for his dinner and bread and
cheese. Sometimes after a heavy night he had such a headache that he could not
drink his coffee, and he gave his lesson with heaviness of spirit. For these
occasions he kept a few bottles of beer under the bed, and one of these and a
pipe would help him to bear the burden of life.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A hair of the dog that bit him,&rdquo; he would say as he poured out the
beer, carefully so that the foam should not make him wait too long to drink.
</p>

<p>
Then he would talk to Philip of the university, the quarrels between rival
corps, the duels, and the merits of this and that professor. Philip learnt more
of life from him than of mathematics. Sometimes Wharton would sit back with a
laugh and say:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here, we&rsquo;ve not done anything today. You needn&rsquo;t pay me
for the lesson.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
This was something new and very interesting, and he felt that it was of greater
import than trigonometry, which he never could understand. It was like a window
on life that he had a chance of peeping through, and he looked with a wildly
beating heart.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, you can keep your dirty money,&rdquo; said Wharton.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But how about your dinner?&rdquo; said Philip, with a smile, for he knew
exactly how his master&rsquo;s finances stood.
</p>

<p>
Wharton had even asked him to pay him the two shillings which the lesson cost
once a week rather than once a month, since it made things less complicated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, never mind my dinner. It won&rsquo;t be the first time I&rsquo;ve
dined off a bottle of beer, and my mind&rsquo;s never clearer than when I
do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He dived under the bed (the sheets were gray with want of washing), and fished
out another bottle. Philip, who was young and did not know the good things of
life, refused to share it with him, so he drank alone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How long are you going to stay here?&rdquo; asked Wharton.
</p>

<p>
Both he and Philip had given up with relief the pretence of mathematics.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. I suppose about a year. Then my people want me
to go to Oxford.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Wharton gave a contemptuous shrug of the shoulders. It was a new experience for
Philip to learn that there were persons who did not look upon that seat of
learning with awe.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you want to go there for? You&rsquo;ll only be a glorified
schoolboy. Why don&rsquo;t you matriculate here? A year&rsquo;s no good. Spend
five years here. You know, there are two good things in life, freedom of
thought and freedom of action. In France you get freedom of action: you can do
what you like and nobody bothers, but you must think like everybody else. In
Germany you must do what everybody else does, but you may think as you choose.
They&rsquo;re both very good things. I personally prefer freedom of thought.
But in England you get neither: you&rsquo;re ground down by convention. You
can&rsquo;t think as you like and you can&rsquo;t act as you like. That&rsquo;s
because it&rsquo;s a democratic nation. I expect America&rsquo;s worse.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He leaned back cautiously, for the chair on which he sat had a ricketty leg,
and it was disconcerting when a rhetorical flourish was interrupted by a sudden
fall to the floor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I ought to go back to England this year, but if I can scrape together
enough to keep body and soul on speaking terms I shall stay another twelve
months. But then I shall have to go. And I must leave all this&rdquo;&mdash;he
waved his arm round the dirty garret, with its unmade bed, the clothes lying on
the floor, a row of empty beer bottles against the wall, piles of unbound,
ragged books in every corner&mdash;&ldquo;for some provincial university where
I shall try and get a chair of philology. And I shall play tennis and go to
tea-parties.&rdquo; He interrupted himself and gave Philip, very neatly
dressed, with a clean collar on and his hair well-brushed, a quizzical look.
&ldquo;And, my God! I shall have to wash.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip reddened, feeling his own spruceness an intolerable reproach; for of
late he had begun to pay some attention to his toilet, and he had come out from
England with a pretty selection of ties.
</p>

<p>
The summer came upon the country like a conqueror. Each day was beautiful. The
sky had an arrogant blue which goaded the nerves like a spur. The green of the
trees in the Anlage was violent and crude; and the houses, when the sun caught
them, had a dazzling white which stimulated till it hurt. Sometimes on his way
back from Wharton Philip would sit in the shade on one of the benches in the
Anlage, enjoying the coolness and watching the patterns of light which the sun,
shining through the leaves, made on the ground. His soul danced with delight as
gaily as the sunbeams. He revelled in those moments of idleness stolen from his
work. Sometimes he sauntered through the streets of the old town. He looked
with awe at the students of the corps, their cheeks gashed and red, who
swaggered about in their coloured caps. In the afternoons he wandered about the
hills with the girls in the Frau Professor&rsquo;s house, and sometimes they
went up the river and had tea in a leafy beer-garden. In the evenings they
walked round and round the Stadtgarten, listening to the band.
</p>

<p>
Philip soon learned the various interests of the household. Fraulein Thekla,
the professor&rsquo;s elder daughter, was engaged to a man in England who had
spent twelve months in the house to learn German, and their marriage was to
take place at the end of the year. But the young man wrote that his father, an
india-rubber merchant who lived in Slough, did not approve of the union, and
Fraulein Thekla was often in tears. Sometimes she and her mother might be seen,
with stern eyes and determined mouths, looking over the letters of the
reluctant lover. Thekla painted in water colour, and occasionally she and
Philip, with another of the girls to keep them company, would go out and paint
little pictures. The pretty Fraulein Hedwig had amorous troubles too. She was
the daughter of a merchant in Berlin and a dashing hussar had fallen in love
with her, a von if you please: but his parents opposed a marriage with a person
of her condition, and she had been sent to Heidelberg to forget him. She could
never, never do this, and corresponded with him continually, and he was making
every effort to induce an exasperating father to change his mind. She told all
this to Philip with pretty sighs and becoming blushes, and showed him the
photograph of the gay lieutenant. Philip liked her best of all the girls at the
Frau Professor&rsquo;s, and on their walks always tried to get by her side. He
blushed a great deal when the others chaffed him for his obvious preference. He
made the first declaration in his life to Fraulein Hedwig, but unfortunately it
was an accident, and it happened in this manner. In the evenings when they did
not go out, the young women sang little songs in the green velvet drawing-room,
while Fraulein Anna, who always made herself useful, industriously accompanied.
Fraulein Hedwig&rsquo;s favourite song was called Ich liebe dich, I love you;
and one evening after she had sung this, when Philip was standing with her on
the balcony, looking at the stars, it occurred to him to make some remark about
it. He began:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ich liebe dich.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His German was halting, and he looked about for the word he wanted. The pause
was infinitesimal, but before he could go on Fraulein Hedwig said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ach, Herr Carey, Sie mussen mir nicht du sagen&mdash;you mustn&rsquo;t
talk to me in the second person singular.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip felt himself grow hot all over, for he would never have dared to do
anything so familiar, and he could think of nothing on earth to say. It would
be ungallant to explain that he was not making an observation, but merely
mentioning the title of a song.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Entschuldigen Sie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I beg your pardon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It does not matter,&rdquo; she whispered.
</p>

<p>
She smiled pleasantly, quietly took his hand and pressed it, then turned back
into the drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
Next day he was so embarrassed that he could not speak to her, and in his
shyness did all that was possible to avoid her. When he was asked to go for the
usual walk he refused because, he said, he had work to do. But Fraulein Hedwig
seized an opportunity to speak to him alone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why are you behaving in this way?&rdquo; she said kindly. &ldquo;You
know, I&rsquo;m not angry with you for what you said last night. You
can&rsquo;t help it if you love me. I&rsquo;m flattered. But although I&rsquo;m
not exactly engaged to Hermann I can never love anyone else, and I look upon
myself as his bride.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip blushed again, but he put on quite the expression of a rejected lover.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll be very happy,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
Professor Erlin gave Philip a lesson every day. He made out a list of books
which Philip was to read till he was ready for the final achievement of Faust,
and meanwhile, ingeniously enough, started him on a German translation of one
of the plays by Shakespeare which Philip had studied at school. It was the
period in Germany of Goethe&rsquo;s highest fame. Notwithstanding his rather
condescending attitude towards patriotism he had been adopted as the national
poet, and seemed since the war of seventy to be one of the most significant
glories of national unity. The enthusiastic seemed in the wildness of the
Walpurgisnacht to hear the rattle of artillery at Gravelotte. But one mark of a
writer&rsquo;s greatness is that different minds can find in him different
inspirations; and Professor Erlin, who hated the Prussians, gave his
enthusiastic admiration to Goethe because his works, Olympian and sedate,
offered the only refuge for a sane mind against the onslaughts of the present
generation. There was a dramatist whose name of late had been much heard at
Heidelberg, and the winter before one of his plays had been given at the
theatre amid the cheers of adherents and the hisses of decent people. Philip
heard discussions about it at the Frau Professor&rsquo;s long table, and at
these Professor Erlin lost his wonted calm: he beat the table with his fist,
and drowned all opposition with the roar of his fine deep voice. It was
nonsense and obscene nonsense. He forced himself to sit the play out, but he
did not know whether he was more bored or nauseated. If that was what the
theatre was coming to, then it was high time the police stepped in and closed
the playhouses. He was no prude and could laugh as well as anyone at the witty
immorality of a farce at the Palais Royal, but here was nothing but filth. With
an emphatic gesture he held his nose and whistled through his teeth. It was the
ruin of the family, the uprooting of morals, the destruction of Germany.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aber, Adolf,&rdquo; said the Frau Professor from the other end of the
table. &ldquo;Calm yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He shook his fist at her. He was the mildest of creatures and ventured upon no
action of his life without consulting her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Helene, I tell you this,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I would sooner my
daughters were lying dead at my feet than see them listening to the garbage of
that shameless fellow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The play was The Doll&rsquo;s House and the author was Henrik Ibsen.
</p>

<p>
Professor Erlin classed him with Richard Wagner, but of him he spoke not with
anger but with good-humoured laughter. He was a charlatan but a successful
charlatan, and in that was always something for the comic spirit to rejoice in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Verruckter Kerl! A madman!&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
He had seen Lohengrin and that passed muster. It was dull but no worse. But
Siegfried! When he mentioned it Professor Erlin leaned his head on his hand and
bellowed with laughter. Not a melody in it from beginning to end! He could
imagine Richard Wagner sitting in his box and laughing till his sides ached at
the sight of all the people who were taking it seriously. It was the greatest
hoax of the nineteenth century. He lifted his glass of beer to his lips, threw
back his head, and drank till the glass was empty. Then wiping his mouth with
the back of his hand, he said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I tell you young people that before the nineteenth century is out Wagner
will be as dead as mutton. Wagner! I would give all his works for one opera by
Donizetti.&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>XXV</h2>

<p>
The oddest of Philip&rsquo;s masters was his teacher of French. Monsieur Ducroz
was a citizen of Geneva. He was a tall old man, with a sallow skin and hollow
cheeks; his gray hair was thin and long. He wore shabby black clothes, with
holes at the elbows of his coat and frayed trousers. His linen was very dirty.
Philip had never seen him in a clean collar. He was a man of few words, who
gave his lesson conscientiously but without enthusiasm, arriving as the clock
struck and leaving on the minute. His charges were very small. He was taciturn,
and what Philip learnt about him he learnt from others: it appeared that he had
fought with Garibaldi against the Pope, but had left Italy in disgust when it
was clear that all his efforts for freedom, by which he meant the establishment
of a republic, tended to no more than an exchange of yokes; he had been
expelled from Geneva for it was not known what political offences. Philip
looked upon him with puzzled surprise; for he was very unlike his idea of the
revolutionary: he spoke in a low voice and was extraordinarily polite; he never
sat down till he was asked to; and when on rare occasions he met Philip in the
street took off his hat with an elaborate gesture; he never laughed, he never
even smiled. A more complete imagination than Philip&rsquo;s might have
pictured a youth of splendid hope, for he must have been entering upon manhood
in 1848 when kings, remembering their brother of France, went about with an
uneasy crick in their necks; and perhaps that passion for liberty which passed
through Europe, sweeping before it what of absolutism and tyranny had reared
its head during the reaction from the revolution of 1789, filled no breast with
a hotter fire. One might fancy him, passionate with theories of human equality
and human rights, discussing, arguing, fighting behind barricades in Paris,
flying before the Austrian cavalry in Milan, imprisoned here, exiled from
there, hoping on and upborne ever with the word which seemed so magical, the
word Liberty; till at last, broken with disease and starvation, old, without
means to keep body and soul together but such lessons as he could pick up from
poor students, he found himself in that little neat town under the heel of a
personal tyranny greater than any in Europe. Perhaps his taciturnity hid a
contempt for the human race which had abandoned the great dreams of his youth
and now wallowed in sluggish ease; or perhaps these thirty years of revolution
had taught him that men are unfit for liberty, and he thought that he had spent
his life in the pursuit of that which was not worth the finding. Or maybe he
was tired out and waited only with indifference for the release of death.
</p>

<p>
One day Philip, with the bluntness of his age, asked him if it was true he had
been with Garibaldi. The old man did not seem to attach any importance to the
question. He answered quite quietly in as low a voice as usual.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oui, monsieur.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They say you were in the Commune?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do they? Shall we get on with our work?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He held the book open and Philip, intimidated, began to translate the passage
he had prepared.
</p>

<p>
One day Monsieur Ducroz seemed to be in great pain. He had been scarcely able
to drag himself up the many stairs to Philip&rsquo;s room: and when he arrived
sat down heavily, his sallow face drawn, with beads of sweat on his forehead,
trying to recover himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re ill,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s of no consequence.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Philip saw that he was suffering, and at the end of the hour asked whether
he would not prefer to give no more lessons till he was better.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the old man, in his even low voice. &ldquo;I prefer to
go on while I am able.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip, morbidly nervous when he had to make any reference to money, reddened.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But it won&rsquo;t make any difference to you,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay for the lessons just the same. If you wouldn&rsquo;t mind
I&rsquo;d like to give you the money for next week in advance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Monsieur Ducroz charged eighteen pence an hour. Philip took a ten-mark piece
out of his pocket and shyly put it on the table. He could not bring himself to
offer it as if the old man were a beggar.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In that case I think I won&rsquo;t come again till I&rsquo;m
better.&rdquo; He took the coin and, without anything more than the elaborate
bow with which he always took his leave, went out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bonjour, monsieur.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was vaguely disappointed. Thinking he had done a generous thing, he had
expected that Monsieur Ducroz would overwhelm him with expressions of
gratitude. He was taken aback to find that the old teacher accepted the present
as though it were his due. He was so young, he did not realise how much less is
the sense of obligation in those who receive favours than in those who grant
them. Monsieur Ducroz appeared again five or six days later. He tottered a
little more and was very weak, but seemed to have overcome the severity of the
attack. He was no more communicative than he had been before. He remained
mysterious, aloof, and dirty. He made no reference to his illness till after
the lesson: and then, just as he was leaving, at the door, which he held open,
he paused. He hesitated, as though to speak were difficult.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for the money you gave me I should have starved.
It was all I had to live on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He made his solemn, obsequious bow, and went out. Philip felt a little lump in
his throat. He seemed to realise in a fashion the hopeless bitterness of the
old man&rsquo;s struggle, and how hard life was for him when to himself it was
so pleasant.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>XXVI</h2>

<p>
Philip had spent three months in Heidelberg when one morning the Frau Professor
told him that an Englishman named Hayward was coming to stay in the house, and
the same evening at supper he saw a new face. For some days the family had
lived in a state of excitement. First, as the result of heaven knows what
scheming, by dint of humble prayers and veiled threats, the parents of the
young Englishman to whom Fraulein Thekla was engaged had invited her to visit
them in England, and she had set off with an album of water colours to show how
accomplished she was and a bundle of letters to prove how deeply the young man
had compromised himself. A week later Fraulein Hedwig with radiant smiles
announced that the lieutenant of her affections was coming to Heidelberg with
his father and mother. Exhausted by the importunity of their son and touched by
the dowry which Fraulein Hedwig&rsquo;s father offered, the lieutenant&rsquo;s
parents had consented to pass through Heidelberg to make the young
woman&rsquo;s acquaintance. The interview was satisfactory and Fraulein Hedwig
had the satisfaction of showing her lover in the Stadtgarten to the whole of
Frau Professor Erlin&rsquo;s household. The silent old ladies who sat at the
top of the table near the Frau Professor were in a flutter, and when Fraulein
Hedwig said she was to go home at once for the formal engagement to take place,
the Frau Professor, regardless of expense, said she would give a Maibowle.
Professor Erlin prided himself on his skill in preparing this mild intoxicant,
and after supper the large bowl of hock and soda, with scented herbs floating
in it and wild strawberries, was placed with solemnity on the round table in
the drawing-room. Fraulein Anna teased Philip about the departure of his
lady-love, and he felt very uncomfortable and rather melancholy. Fraulein
Hedwig sang several songs, Fraulein Anna played the Wedding March, and the
Professor sang Die Wacht am Rhein. Amid all this jollification Philip paid
little attention to the new arrival. They had sat opposite one another at
supper, but Philip was chattering busily with Fraulein Hedwig, and the
stranger, knowing no German, had eaten his food in silence. Philip, observing
that he wore a pale blue tie, had on that account taken a sudden dislike to
him. He was a man of twenty-six, very fair, with long, wavy hair through which
he passed his hand frequently with a careless gesture. His eyes were large and
blue, but the blue was very pale, and they looked rather tired already. He was
clean-shaven, and his mouth, notwithstanding its thin lips, was well-shaped.
Fraulein Anna took an interest in physiognomy, and she made Philip notice
afterwards how finely shaped was his skull, and how weak was the lower part of
his face. The head, she remarked, was the head of a thinker, but the jaw lacked
character. Fraulein Anna, foredoomed to a spinster&rsquo;s life, with her high
cheek-bones and large misshapen nose, laid great stress upon character. While
they talked of him he stood a little apart from the others, watching the noisy
party with a good-humoured but faintly supercilious expression. He was tall and
slim. He held himself with a deliberate grace. Weeks, one of the American
students, seeing him alone, went up and began to talk to him. The pair were
oddly contrasted: the American very neat in his black coat and pepper-and-salt
trousers, thin and dried-up, with something of ecclesiastical unction already
in his manner; and the Englishman in his loose tweed suit, large-limbed and
slow of gesture.
</p>

<p>
Philip did not speak to the newcomer till next day. They found themselves alone
on the balcony of the drawing-room before dinner. Hayward addressed him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re English, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is the food always as bad it was last night?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always about the same.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Beastly, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Beastly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip had found nothing wrong with the food at all, and in fact had eaten it
in large quantities with appetite and enjoyment, but he did not want to show
himself a person of so little discrimination as to think a dinner good which
another thought execrable.
</p>

<p>
Fraulein Thekla&rsquo;s visit to England made it necessary for her sister to do
more in the house, and she could not often spare the time for long walks; and
Fraulein Cacilie, with her long plait of fair hair and her little snub-nosed
face, had of late shown a certain disinclination for society. Fraulein Hedwig
was gone, and Weeks, the American who generally accompanied them on their
rambles, had set out for a tour of South Germany. Philip was left a good deal
to himself. Hayward sought his acquaintance; but Philip had an unfortunate
trait: from shyness or from some atavistic inheritance of the cave-dweller, he
always disliked people on first acquaintance; and it was not till he became
used to them that he got over his first impression. It made him difficult of
access. He received Hayward&rsquo;s advances very shyly, and when Hayward asked
him one day to go for a walk he accepted only because he could not think of a
civil excuse. He made his usual apology, angry with himself for the flushing
cheeks he could not control, and trying to carry it off with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t walk very fast.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good heavens, I don&rsquo;t walk for a wager. I prefer to stroll.
Don&rsquo;t you remember the chapter in Marius where Pater talks of the gentle
exercise of walking as the best incentive to conversation?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was a good listener; though he often thought of clever things to say, it
was seldom till after the opportunity to say them had passed; but Hayward was
communicative; anyone more experienced than Philip might have thought he liked
to hear himself talk. His supercilious attitude impressed Philip. He could not
help admiring, and yet being awed by, a man who faintly despised so many things
which Philip had looked upon as almost sacred. He cast down the fetish of
exercise, damning with the contemptuous word pot-hunters all those who devoted
themselves to its various forms; and Philip did not realise that he was merely
putting up in its stead the other fetish of culture.
</p>

<p>
They wandered up to the castle, and sat on the terrace that overlooked the
town. It nestled in the valley along the pleasant Neckar with a comfortable
friendliness. The smoke from the chimneys hung over it, a pale blue haze; and
the tall roofs, the spires of the churches, gave it a pleasantly medieval air.
There was a homeliness in it which warmed the heart. Hayward talked of Richard
Feverel and Madame Bovary, of Verlaine, Dante, and Matthew Arnold. In those
days Fitzgerald&rsquo;s translation of Omar Khayyam was known only to the
elect, and Hayward repeated it to Philip. He was very fond of reciting poetry,
his own and that of others, which he did in a monotonous sing-song. By the time
they reached home Philip&rsquo;s distrust of Hayward was changed to
enthusiastic admiration.
</p>

<p>
They made a practice of walking together every afternoon, and Philip learned
presently something of Hayward&rsquo;s circumstances. He was the son of a
country judge, on whose death some time before he had inherited three hundred a
year. His record at Charterhouse was so brilliant that when he went to
Cambridge the Master of Trinity Hall went out of his way to express his
satisfaction that he was going to that college. He prepared himself for a
distinguished career. He moved in the most intellectual circles: he read
Browning with enthusiasm and turned up his well-shaped nose at Tennyson; he
knew all the details of Shelley&rsquo;s treatment of Harriet; he dabbled in the
history of art (on the walls of his rooms were reproductions of pictures by G.
F. Watts, Burne-Jones, and Botticelli); and he wrote not without distinction
verses of a pessimistic character. His friends told one another that he was a
man of excellent gifts, and he listened to them willingly when they prophesied
his future eminence. In course of time he became an authority on art and
literature. He came under the influence of Newman&rsquo;s Apologia; the
picturesqueness of the Roman Catholic faith appealed to his esthetic
sensibility; and it was only the fear of his father&rsquo;s wrath (a plain,
blunt man of narrow ideas, who read Macaulay) which prevented him from
&lsquo;going over.&rsquo; When he only got a pass degree his friends were
astonished; but he shrugged his shoulders and delicately insinuated that he was
not the dupe of examiners. He made one feel that a first class was ever so
slightly vulgar. He described one of the vivas with tolerant humour; some
fellow in an outrageous collar was asking him questions in logic; it was
infinitely tedious, and suddenly he noticed that he wore elastic-sided boots:
it was grotesque and ridiculous; so he withdrew his mind and thought of the
gothic beauty of the Chapel at King&rsquo;s. But he had spent some delightful
days at Cambridge; he had given better dinners than anyone he knew; and the
conversation in his rooms had been often memorable. He quoted to Philip the
exquisite epigram:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They told me, Herakleitus, they told me you were dead.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And now, when he related again the picturesque little anecdote about the
examiner and his boots, he laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course it was folly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it was a folly in
which there was something fine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip, with a little thrill, thought it magnificent.
</p>

<p>
Then Hayward went to London to read for the Bar. He had charming rooms in
Clement&rsquo;s Inn, with panelled walls, and he tried to make them look like
his old rooms at the Hall. He had ambitions that were vaguely political, he
described himself as a Whig, and he was put up for a club which was of Liberal
but gentlemanly flavour. His idea was to practise at the Bar (he chose the
Chancery side as less brutal), and get a seat for some pleasant constituency as
soon as the various promises made him were carried out; meanwhile he went a
great deal to the opera, and made acquaintance with a small number of charming
people who admired the things that he admired. He joined a dining-club of which
the motto was, The Whole, The Good, and The Beautiful. He formed a platonic
friendship with a lady some years older than himself, who lived in Kensington
Square; and nearly every afternoon he drank tea with her by the light of shaded
candles, and talked of George Meredith and Walter Pater. It was notorious that
any fool could pass the examinations of the Bar Council, and he pursued his
studies in a dilatory fashion. When he was ploughed for his final he looked
upon it as a personal affront. At the same time the lady in Kensington Square
told him that her husband was coming home from India on leave, and was a man,
though worthy in every way, of a commonplace mind, who would not understand a
young man&rsquo;s frequent visits. Hayward felt that life was full of ugliness,
his soul revolted from the thought of affronting again the cynicism of
examiners, and he saw something rather splendid in kicking away the ball which
lay at his feet. He was also a good deal in debt: it was difficult to live in
London like a gentleman on three hundred a year; and his heart yearned for the
Venice and Florence which John Ruskin had so magically described. He felt that
he was unsuited to the vulgar bustle of the Bar, for he had discovered that it
was not sufficient to put your name on a door to get briefs; and modern
politics seemed to lack nobility. He felt himself a poet. He disposed of his
rooms in Clement&rsquo;s Inn and went to Italy. He had spent a winter in
Florence and a winter in Rome, and now was passing his second summer abroad in
Germany so that he might read Goethe in the original.
</p>

<p>
Hayward had one gift which was very precious. He had a real feeling for
literature, and he could impart his own passion with an admirable fluency. He
could throw himself into sympathy with a writer and see all that was best in
him, and then he could talk about him with understanding. Philip had read a
great deal, but he had read without discrimination everything that he happened
to come across, and it was very good for him now to meet someone who could
guide his taste. He borrowed books from the small lending library which the
town possessed and began reading all the wonderful things that Hayward spoke
of. He did not read always with enjoyment but invariably with perseverance. He
was eager for self-improvement. He felt himself very ignorant and very humble.
By the end of August, when Weeks returned from South Germany, Philip was
completely under Hayward&rsquo;s influence. Hayward did not like Weeks. He
deplored the American&rsquo;s black coat and pepper-and-salt trousers, and
spoke with a scornful shrug of his New England conscience. Philip listened
complacently to the abuse of a man who had gone out of his way to be kind to
him, but when Weeks in his turn made disagreeable remarks about Hayward he lost
his temper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your new friend looks like a poet,&rdquo; said Weeks, with a thin smile
on his careworn, bitter mouth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is a poet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did he tell you so? In America we should call him a pretty fair specimen
of a waster.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re not in America,&rdquo; said Philip frigidly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How old is he? Twenty-five? And he does nothing but stay in pensions and
write poetry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know him,&rdquo; said Philip hotly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, I do: I&rsquo;ve met a hundred and forty-seven of him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Weeks&rsquo; eyes twinkled, but Philip, who did not understand American humour,
pursed his lips and looked severe. Weeks to Philip seemed a man of middle age,
but he was in point of fact little more than thirty. He had a long, thin body
and the scholar&rsquo;s stoop; his head was large and ugly; he had pale scanty
hair and an earthy skin; his thin mouth and thin, long nose, and the great
protuberance of his frontal bones, gave him an uncouth look. He was cold and
precise in his manner, a bloodless man, without passion; but he had a curious
vein of frivolity which disconcerted the serious-minded among whom his
instincts naturally threw him. He was studying theology in Heidelberg, but the
other theological students of his own nationality looked upon him with
suspicion. He was very unorthodox, which frightened them; and his freakish
humour excited their disapproval.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can you have known a hundred and forty-seven of him?&rdquo; asked
Philip seriously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met him in the Latin Quarter in Paris, and I&rsquo;ve met him
in pensions in Berlin and Munich. He lives in small hotels in Perugia and
Assisi. He stands by the dozen before the Botticellis in Florence, and he sits
on all the benches of the Sistine Chapel in Rome. In Italy he drinks a little
too much wine, and in Germany he drinks a great deal too much beer. He always
admires the right thing whatever the right thing is, and one of these days
he&rsquo;s going to write a great work. Think of it, there are a hundred and
forty-seven great works reposing in the bosoms of a hundred and forty-seven
great men, and the tragic thing is that not one of those hundred and
forty-seven great works will ever be written. And yet the world goes on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Weeks spoke seriously, but his gray eyes twinkled a little at the end of his
long speech, and Philip flushed when he saw that the American was making fun of
him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You do talk rot,&rdquo; he said crossly.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>XXVII</h2>

<p>
Weeks had two little rooms at the back of Frau Erlin&rsquo;s house, and one of
them, arranged as a parlour, was comfortable enough for him to invite people to
sit in. After supper, urged perhaps by the impish humour which was the despair
of his friends in Cambridge, Mass., he often asked Philip and Hayward to come
in for a chat. He received them with elaborate courtesy and insisted on their
sitting in the only two comfortable chairs in the room. Though he did not drink
himself, with a politeness of which Philip recognised the irony, he put a
couple of bottles of beer at Hayward&rsquo;s elbow, and he insisted on lighting
matches whenever in the heat of argument Hayward&rsquo;s pipe went out. At the
beginning of their acquaintance Hayward, as a member of so celebrated a
university, had adopted a patronising attitude towards Weeks, who was a
graduate of Harvard; and when by chance the conversation turned upon the Greek
tragedians, a subject upon which Hayward felt he spoke with authority, he had
assumed the air that it was his part to give information rather than to
exchange ideas. Weeks had listened politely, with smiling modesty, till Hayward
finished; then he asked one or two insidious questions, so innocent in
appearance that Hayward, not seeing into what a quandary they led him, answered
blandly; Weeks made a courteous objection, then a correction of fact, after
that a quotation from some little known Latin commentator, then a reference to
a German authority; and the fact was disclosed that he was a scholar. With
smiling ease, apologetically, Weeks tore to pieces all that Hayward had said;
with elaborate civility he displayed the superficiality of his attainments. He
mocked him with gentle irony. Philip could not help seeing that Hayward looked
a perfect fool, and Hayward had not the sense to hold his tongue; in his
irritation, his self-assurance undaunted, he attempted to argue: he made wild
statements and Weeks amicably corrected them; he reasoned falsely and Weeks
proved that he was absurd: Weeks confessed that he had taught Greek Literature
at Harvard. Hayward gave a laugh of scorn.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I might have known it. Of course you read Greek like a
schoolmaster,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I read it like a poet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And do you find it more poetic when you don&rsquo;t quite know what it
means? I thought it was only in revealed religion that a mistranslation
improved the sense.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At last, having finished the beer, Hayward left Weeks&rsquo; room hot and
dishevelled; with an angry gesture he said to Philip:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course the man&rsquo;s a pedant. He has no real feeling for beauty.
Accuracy is the virtue of clerks. It&rsquo;s the spirit of the Greeks that we
aim at. Weeks is like that fellow who went to hear Rubenstein and complained
that he played false notes. False notes! What did they matter when he played
divinely?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip, not knowing how many incompetent people have found solace in these
false notes, was much impressed.
</p>

<p>
Hayward could never resist the opportunity which Weeks offered him of regaining
ground lost on a previous occasion, and Weeks was able with the greatest ease
to draw him into a discussion. Though he could not help seeing how small his
attainments were beside the American&rsquo;s, his British pertinacity, his
wounded vanity (perhaps they are the same thing), would not allow him to give
up the struggle. Hayward seemed to take a delight in displaying his ignorance,
self-satisfaction, and wrongheadedness. Whenever Hayward said something which
was illogical, Weeks in a few words would show the falseness of his reasoning,
pause for a moment to enjoy his triumph, and then hurry on to another subject
as though Christian charity impelled him to spare the vanquished foe. Philip
tried sometimes to put in something to help his friend, and Weeks gently
crushed him, but so kindly, differently from the way in which he answered
Hayward, that even Philip, outrageously sensitive, could not feel hurt. Now and
then, losing his calm as he felt himself more and more foolish, Hayward became
abusive, and only the American&rsquo;s smiling politeness prevented the
argument from degenerating into a quarrel. On these occasions when Hayward left
Weeks&rsquo; room he muttered angrily:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Damned Yankee!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That settled it. It was a perfect answer to an argument which had seemed
unanswerable.
</p>

<p>
Though they began by discussing all manner of subjects in Weeks&rsquo; little
room eventually the conversation always turned to religion: the theological
student took a professional interest in it, and Hayward welcomed a subject in
which hard facts need not disconcert him; when feeling is the gauge you can
snap your angers at logic, and when your logic is weak that is very agreeable.
Hayward found it difficult to explain his beliefs to Philip without a great
flow of words; but it was clear (and this fell in with Philip&rsquo;s idea of
the natural order of things), that he had been brought up in the church by law
established. Though he had now given up all idea of becoming a Roman Catholic,
he still looked upon that communion with sympathy. He had much to say in its
praise, and he compared favourably its gorgeous ceremonies with the simple
services of the Church of England. He gave Philip Newman&rsquo;s Apologia to
read, and Philip, finding it very dull, nevertheless read it to the end.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Read it for its style, not for its matter,&rdquo; said Hayward.
</p>

<p>
He talked enthusiastically of the music at the Oratory, and said charming
things about the connection between incense and the devotional spirit. Weeks
listened to him with his frigid smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You think it proves the truth of Roman Catholicism that John Henry
Newman wrote good English and that Cardinal Manning has a picturesque
appearance?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hayward hinted that he had gone through much trouble with his soul. For a year
he had swum in a sea of darkness. He passed his fingers through his fair,
waving hair and told them that he would not for five hundred pounds endure
again those agonies of mind. Fortunately he had reached calm waters at last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what do you believe?&rdquo; asked Philip, who was never satisfied
with vague statements.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I believe in the Whole, the Good, and the Beautiful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hayward with his loose large limbs and the fine carriage of his head looked
very handsome when he said this, and he said it with an air.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that how you would describe your religion in a census paper?&rdquo;
asked Weeks, in mild tones.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hate the rigid definition: it&rsquo;s so ugly, so obvious. If you like
I will say that I believe in the church of the Duke of Wellington and Mr.
Gladstone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Church of England,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh wise young man!&rdquo; retorted Hayward, with a smile which made
Philip blush, for he felt that in putting into plain words what the other had
expressed in a paraphrase, he had been guilty of vulgarity. &ldquo;I belong to
the Church of England. But I love the gold and the silk which clothe the priest
of Rome, and his celibacy, and the confessional, and purgatory: and in the
darkness of an Italian cathedral, incense-laden and mysterious, I believe with
all my heart in the miracle of the Mass. In Venice I have seen a fisherwoman
come in, barefoot, throw down her basket of fish by her side, fall on her
knees, and pray to the Madonna; and that I felt was the real faith, and I
prayed and believed with her. But I believe also in Aphrodite and Apollo and
the Great God Pan.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had a charming voice, and he chose his words as he spoke; he uttered them
almost rhythmically. He would have gone on, but Weeks opened a second bottle of
beer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me give you something to drink.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hayward turned to Philip with the slightly condescending gesture which so
impressed the youth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now are you satisfied?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
Philip, somewhat bewildered, confessed that he was.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m disappointed that you didn&rsquo;t add a little
Buddhism,&rdquo; said Weeks. &ldquo;And I confess I have a sort of sympathy for
Mahomet; I regret that you should have left him out in the cold.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hayward laughed, for he was in a good humour with himself that evening, and the
ring of his sentences still sounded pleasant in his ears. He emptied his glass.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect you to understand me,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;With your cold American intelligence you can only adopt the critical
attitude. Emerson and all that sort of thing. But what is criticism? Criticism
is purely destructive; anyone can destroy, but not everyone can build up. You
are a pedant, my dear fellow. The important thing is to construct: I am
constructive; I am a poet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Weeks looked at him with eyes which seemed at the same time to be quite grave
and yet to be smiling brightly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think, if you don&rsquo;t mind my saying so, you&rsquo;re a little
drunk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing to speak of,&rdquo; answered Hayward cheerfully. &ldquo;And not
enough for me to be unable to overwhelm you in argument. But come, I have
unbosomed my soul; now tell us what your religion is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Weeks put his head on one side so that he looked like a sparrow on a perch.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to find that out for years. I think I&rsquo;m a
Unitarian.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s a dissenter,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
He could not imagine why they both burst into laughter, Hayward uproariously,
and Weeks with a funny chuckle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And in England dissenters aren&rsquo;t gentlemen, are they?&rdquo; asked
Weeks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, if you ask me point-blank, they&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; replied
Philip rather crossly.
</p>

<p>
He hated being laughed at, and they laughed again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And will you tell me what a gentleman is?&rdquo; asked Weeks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know; everyone knows what it is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you a gentleman?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
No doubt had ever crossed Philip&rsquo;s mind on the subject, but he knew it
was not a thing to state of oneself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If a man tells you he&rsquo;s a gentleman you can bet your boots he
isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he retorted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Am I a gentleman?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip&rsquo;s truthfulness made it difficult for him to answer, but he was
naturally polite.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, well, you&rsquo;re different,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
American, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose we may take it that only Englishmen are gentlemen,&rdquo; said
Weeks gravely.
</p>

<p>
Philip did not contradict him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you give me a few more particulars?&rdquo; asked Weeks.
</p>

<p>
Philip reddened, but, growing angry, did not care if he made himself
ridiculous.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can give you plenty.&rdquo; He remembered his uncle&rsquo;s saying
that it took three generations to make a gentleman: it was a companion proverb
to the silk purse and the sow&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;First of all he&rsquo;s the
son of a gentleman, and he&rsquo;s been to a public school, and to Oxford or
Cambridge.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Edinburgh wouldn&rsquo;t do, I suppose?&rdquo; asked Weeks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And he talks English like a gentleman, and he wears the right sort of
things, and if he&rsquo;s a gentleman he can always tell if another
chap&rsquo;s a gentleman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It seemed rather lame to Philip as he went on, but there it was: that was what
he meant by the word, and everyone he had ever known had meant that too.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is evident to me that I am not a gentleman,&rdquo; said Weeks.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you should have been so surprised because I was a
dissenter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know what a Unitarian is,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
Weeks in his odd way again put his head on one side: you almost expected him to
twitter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A Unitarian very earnestly disbelieves in almost everything that anybody
else believes, and he has a very lively sustaining faith in he doesn&rsquo;t
quite know what.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you should make fun of me,&rdquo; said Philip.
&ldquo;I really want to know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear friend, I&rsquo;m not making fun of you. I have arrived at that
definition after years of great labour and the most anxious, nerve-racking
study.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When Philip and Hayward got up to go, Weeks handed Philip a little book in a
paper cover.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you can read French pretty well by now. I wonder if this would
amuse you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip thanked him and, taking the book, looked at the title. It was
Renan&rsquo;s Vie de Jesus.

<h2>XXVIII</h2>

<p>
It occurred neither to Hayward nor to Weeks that the conversations which helped
them to pass an idle evening were being turned over afterwards in
Philip&rsquo;s active brain. It had never struck him before that religion was a
matter upon which discussion was possible. To him it meant the Church of
England, and not to believe in its tenets was a sign of wilfulness which could
not fail of punishment here or hereafter. There was some doubt in his mind
about the chastisement of unbelievers. It was possible that a merciful judge,
reserving the flames of hell for the heathen&mdash;Mahommedans, Buddhists, and
the rest&mdash;would spare Dissenters and Roman Catholics (though at the cost
of how much humiliation when they were made to realise their error!), and it
was also possible that He would be pitiful to those who had had no chance of
learning the truth,&mdash;this was reasonable enough, though such were the
activities of the Missionary Society there could not be many in this
condition&mdash;but if the chance had been theirs and they had neglected it (in
which category were obviously Roman Catholics and Dissenters), the punishment
was sure and merited. It was clear that the miscreant was in a parlous state.
Perhaps Philip had not been taught it in so many words, but certainly the
impression had been given him that only members of the Church of England had
any real hope of eternal happiness.
</p>

<p>
One of the things that Philip had heard definitely stated was that the
unbeliever was a wicked and a vicious man; but Weeks, though he believed in
hardly anything that Philip believed, led a life of Christian purity. Philip
had received little kindness in his life, and he was touched by the
American&rsquo;s desire to help him: once when a cold kept him in bed for three
days, Weeks nursed him like a mother. There was neither vice nor wickedness in
him, but only sincerity and loving-kindness. It was evidently possible to be
virtuous and unbelieving.
</p>

<p>
Also Philip had been given to understand that people adhered to other faiths
only from obstinacy or self-interest: in their hearts they knew they were
false; they deliberately sought to deceive others. Now, for the sake of his
German he had been accustomed on Sunday mornings to attend the Lutheran
service, but when Hayward arrived he began instead to go with him to Mass. He
noticed that, whereas the Protestant church was nearly empty and the
congregation had a listless air, the Jesuit on the other hand was crowded and
the worshippers seemed to pray with all their hearts. They had not the look of
hypocrites. He was surprised at the contrast; for he knew of course that the
Lutherans, whose faith was closer to that of the Church of England, on that
account were nearer the truth than the Roman Catholics. Most of the
men&mdash;it was largely a masculine congregation&mdash;were South Germans; and
he could not help saying to himself that if he had been born in South Germany
he would certainly have been a Roman Catholic. He might just as well have been
born in a Roman Catholic country as in England; and in England as well in a
Wesleyan, Baptist, or Methodist family as in one that fortunately belonged to
the church by law established. He was a little breathless at the danger he had
run. Philip was on friendly terms with the little Chinaman who sat at table
with him twice each day. His name was Sung. He was always smiling, affable, and
polite. It seemed strange that he should frizzle in hell merely because he was
a Chinaman; but if salvation was possible whatever a man&rsquo;s faith was,
there did not seem to be any particular advantage in belonging to the Church of
England.
</p>

<p>
Philip, more puzzled than he had ever been in his life, sounded Weeks. He had
to be careful, for he was very sensitive to ridicule; and the acidulous humour
with which the American treated the Church of England disconcerted him. Weeks
only puzzled him more. He made Philip acknowledge that those South Germans whom
he saw in the Jesuit church were every bit as firmly convinced of the truth of
Roman Catholicism as he was of that of the Church of England, and from that he
led him to admit that the Mahommedan and the Buddhist were convinced also of
the truth of their respective religions. It looked as though knowing that you
were right meant nothing; they all knew they were right. Weeks had no intention
of undermining the boy&rsquo;s faith, but he was deeply interested in religion,
and found it an absorbing topic of conversation. He had described his own views
accurately when he said that he very earnestly disbelieved in almost everything
that other people believed. Once Philip asked him a question, which he had
heard his uncle put when the conversation at the vicarage had fallen upon some
mildly rationalistic work which was then exciting discussion in the newspapers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why should you be right and all those fellows like St. Anselm and
St. Augustine be wrong?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mean that they were very clever and learned men, while you have
grave doubts whether I am either?&rdquo; asked Weeks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Philip uncertainly, for put in that way his
question seemed impertinent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;St. Augustine believed that the earth was flat and that the sun turned
round it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what that proves.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, it proves that you believe with your generation. Your saints lived
in an age of faith, when it was practically impossible to disbelieve what to us
is positively incredible.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then how d&rsquo;you know that we have the truth now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip thought this over for a moment, then he said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why the things we believe absolutely now
shouldn&rsquo;t be just as wrong as what they believed in the past.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Neither do I.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then how can you believe anything at all?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip asked Weeks what he thought of Hayward&rsquo;s religion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Men have always formed gods in their own image,&rdquo; said Weeks.
&ldquo;He believes in the picturesque.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip paused for a little while, then he said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why one should believe in God at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The words were no sooner out of his mouth than he realised that he had ceased
to do so. It took his breath away like a plunge into cold water. He looked at
Weeks with startled eyes. Suddenly he felt afraid. He left Weeks as quickly as
he could. He wanted to be alone. It was the most startling experience that he
had ever had. He tried to think it all out; it was very exciting, since his
whole life seemed concerned (he thought his decision on this matter must
profoundly affect its course) and a mistake might lead to eternal damnation;
but the more he reflected the more convinced he was; and though during the next
few weeks he read books, aids to scepticism, with eager interest it was only to
confirm him in what he felt instinctively. The fact was that he had ceased to
believe not for this reason or the other, but because he had not the religious
temperament. Faith had been forced upon him from the outside. It was a matter
of environment and example. A new environment and a new example gave him the
opportunity to find himself. He put off the faith of his childhood quite
simply, like a cloak that he no longer needed. At first life seemed strange and
lonely without the belief which, though he never realised it, had been an
unfailing support. He felt like a man who has leaned on a stick and finds
himself forced suddenly to walk without assistance. It really seemed as though
the days were colder and the nights more solitary. But he was upheld by the
excitement; it seemed to make life a more thrilling adventure; and in a little
while the stick which he had thrown aside, the cloak which had fallen from his
shoulders, seemed an intolerable burden of which he had been eased. The
religious exercises which for so many years had been forced upon him were part
and parcel of religion to him. He thought of the collects and epistles which he
had been made to learn by heart, and the long services at the Cathedral through
which he had sat when every limb itched with the desire for movement; and he
remembered those walks at night through muddy roads to the parish church at
Blackstable, and the coldness of that bleak building; he sat with his feet like
ice, his fingers numb and heavy, and all around was the sickly odour of
pomatum. Oh, he had been so bored! His heart leaped when he saw he was free
from all that.
</p>

<p>
He was surprised at himself because he ceased to believe so easily, and, not
knowing that he felt as he did on account of the subtle workings of his inmost
nature, he ascribed the certainty he had reached to his own cleverness. He was
unduly pleased with himself. With youth&rsquo;s lack of sympathy for an
attitude other than its own he despised not a little Weeks and Hayward because
they were content with the vague emotion which they called God and would not
take the further step which to himself seemed so obvious. One day he went alone
up a certain hill so that he might see a view which, he knew not why, filled
him always with wild exhilaration. It was autumn now, but often the days were
cloudless still, and then the sky seemed to glow with a more splendid light: it
was as though nature consciously sought to put a fuller vehemence into the
remaining days of fair weather. He looked down upon the plain, a-quiver with
the sun, stretching vastly before him: in the distance were the roofs of
Mannheim and ever so far away the dimness of Worms. Here and there a more
piercing glitter was the Rhine. The tremendous spaciousness of it was glowing
with rich gold. Philip, as he stood there, his heart beating with sheer joy,
thought how the tempter had stood with Jesus on a high mountain and shown him
the kingdoms of the earth. To Philip, intoxicated with the beauty of the scene,
it seemed that it was the whole world which was spread before him, and he was
eager to step down and enjoy it. He was free from degrading fears and free from
prejudice. He could go his way without the intolerable dread of hell-fire.
Suddenly he realised that he had lost also that burden of responsibility which
made every action of his life a matter of urgent consequence. He could breathe
more freely in a lighter air. He was responsible only to himself for the things
he did. Freedom! He was his own master at last. From old habit, unconsciously
he thanked God that he no longer believed in Him.
</p>

<p>
Drunk with pride in his intelligence and in his fearlessness, Philip entered
deliberately upon a new life. But his loss of faith made less difference in his
behaviour than he expected. Though he had thrown on one side the Christian
dogmas it never occurred to him to criticise the Christian ethics; he accepted
the Christian virtues, and indeed thought it fine to practise them for their
own sake, without a thought of reward or punishment. There was small occasion
for heroism in the Frau Professor&rsquo;s house, but he was a little more
exactly truthful than he had been, and he forced himself to be more than
commonly attentive to the dull, elderly ladies who sometimes engaged him in
conversation. The gentle oath, the violent adjective, which are typical of our
language and which he had cultivated before as a sign of manliness, he now
elaborately eschewed.
</p>

<p>
Having settled the whole matter to his satisfaction he sought to put it out of
his mind, but that was more easily said than done; and he could not prevent the
regrets nor stifle the misgivings which sometimes tormented him. He was so
young and had so few friends that immortality had no particular attractions for
him, and he was able without trouble to give up belief in it; but there was one
thing which made him wretched; he told himself that he was unreasonable, he
tried to laugh himself out of such pathos; but the tears really came to his
eyes when he thought that he would never see again the beautiful mother whose
love for him had grown more precious as the years since her death passed on.
And sometimes, as though the influence of innumerable ancestors, Godfearing and
devout, were working in him unconsciously, there seized him a panic fear that
perhaps after all it was all true, and there was, up there behind the blue sky,
a jealous God who would punish in everlasting flames the atheist. At these
times his reason could offer him no help, he imagined the anguish of a physical
torment which would last endlessly, he felt quite sick with fear and burst into
a violent sweat. At last he would say to himself desperately:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;After all, it&rsquo;s not my fault. I can&rsquo;t force myself to
believe. If there is a God after all and he punishes me because I honestly
don&rsquo;t believe in Him I can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;
</p>

<h2>XXIX</h2>

<p>
Winter set in. Weeks went to Berlin to attend the lectures of Paulssen, and
Hayward began to think of going South. The local theatre opened its doors.
Philip and Hayward went to it two or three times a week with the praiseworthy
intention of improving their German, and Philip found it a more diverting
manner of perfecting himself in the language than listening to sermons. They
found themselves in the midst of a revival of the drama. Several of
Ibsen&rsquo;s plays were on the repertory for the winter; Sudermann&rsquo;s Die
Ehre was then a new play, and on its production in the quiet university town
caused the greatest excitement; it was extravagantly praised and bitterly
attacked; other dramatists followed with plays written under the modern
influence, and Philip witnessed a series of works in which the vileness of
mankind was displayed before him. He had never been to a play in his life till
then (poor touring companies sometimes came to the Assembly Rooms at
Blackstable, but the Vicar, partly on account of his profession, partly because
he thought it would be vulgar, never went to see them) and the passion of the
stage seized him. He felt a thrill the moment he got into the little, shabby,
ill-lit theatre. Soon he came to know the peculiarities of the small company,
and by the casting could tell at once what were the characteristics of the
persons in the drama; but this made no difference to him. To him it was real
life. It was a strange life, dark and tortured, in which men and women showed
to remorseless eyes the evil that was in their hearts: a fair face concealed a
depraved mind; the virtuous used virtue as a mask to hide their secret vice,
the seeming-strong fainted within with their weakness; the honest were corrupt,
the chaste were lewd. You seemed to dwell in a room where the night before an
orgy had taken place: the windows had not been opened in the morning; the air
was foul with the dregs of beer, and stale smoke, and flaring gas. There was no
laughter. At most you sniggered at the hypocrite or the fool: the characters
expressed themselves in cruel words that seemed wrung out of their hearts by
shame and anguish.
</p>

<p>
Philip was carried away by the sordid intensity of it. He seemed to see the
world again in another fashion, and this world too he was anxious to know.
After the play was over he went to a tavern and sat in the bright warmth with
Hayward to eat a sandwich and drink a glass of beer. All round were little
groups of students, talking and laughing; and here and there was a family,
father and mother, a couple of sons and a girl; and sometimes the girl said a
sharp thing, and the father leaned back in his chair and laughed, laughed
heartily. It was very friendly and innocent. There was a pleasant homeliness in
the scene, but for this Philip had no eyes. His thoughts ran on the play he had
just come from.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You do feel it&rsquo;s life, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he said excitedly.
&ldquo;You know, I don&rsquo;t think I can stay here much longer. I want to get
to London so that I can really begin. I want to have experiences. I&rsquo;m so
tired of preparing for life: I want to live it now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sometimes Hayward left Philip to go home by himself. He would never exactly
reply to Philip&rsquo;s eager questioning, but with a merry, rather stupid
laugh, hinted at a romantic amour; he quoted a few lines of Rossetti, and once
showed Philip a sonnet in which passion and purple, pessimism and pathos, were
packed together on the subject of a young lady called Trude. Hayward surrounded
his sordid and vulgar little adventures with a glow of poetry, and thought he
touched hands with Pericles and Pheidias because to describe the object of his
attentions he used the word hetaira instead of one of those, more blunt and
apt, provided by the English language. Philip in the daytime had been led by
curiosity to pass through the little street near the old bridge, with its neat
white houses and green shutters, in which according to Hayward the Fraulein
Trude lived; but the women, with brutal faces and painted cheeks, who came out
of their doors and cried out to him, filled him with fear; and he fled in
horror from the rough hands that sought to detain him. He yearned above all
things for experience and felt himself ridiculous because at his age he had not
enjoyed that which all fiction taught him was the most important thing in life;
but he had the unfortunate gift of seeing things as they were, and the reality
which was offered him differed too terribly from the ideal of his dreams.
</p>

<p>
He did not know how wide a country, arid and precipitous, must be crossed
before the traveller through life comes to an acceptance of reality. It is an
illusion that youth is happy, an illusion of those who have lost it; but the
young know they are wretched, for they are full of the truthless ideals which
have been instilled into them, and each time they come in contact with the real
they are bruised and wounded. It looks as if they were victims of a conspiracy;
for the books they read, ideal by the necessity of selection, and the
conversation of their elders, who look back upon the past through a rosy haze
of forgetfulness, prepare them for an unreal life. They must discover for
themselves that all they have read and all they have been told are lies, lies,
lies; and each discovery is another nail driven into the body on the cross of
life. The strange thing is that each one who has gone through that bitter
disillusionment adds to it in his turn, unconsciously, by the power within him
which is stronger than himself. The companionship of Hayward was the worst
possible thing for Philip. He was a man who saw nothing for himself, but only
through a literary atmosphere, and he was dangerous because he had deceived
himself into sincerity. He honestly mistook his sensuality for romantic
emotion, his vacillation for the artistic temperament, and his idleness for
philosophic calm. His mind, vulgar in its effort at refinement, saw everything
a little larger than life size, with the outlines blurred, in a golden mist of
sentimentality. He lied and never knew that he lied, and when it was pointed
out to him said that lies were beautiful. He was an idealist.

<h2>XXX</h2>

<p>
Philip was restless and dissatisfied. Hayward&rsquo;s poetic allusions troubled
his imagination, and his soul yearned for romance. At least that was how he put
it to himself.
</p>

<p>
And it happened that an incident was taking place in Frau Erlin&rsquo;s house
which increased Philip&rsquo;s preoccupation with the matter of sex. Two or
three times on his walks among the hills he had met Fraulein Cacilie wandering
by herself. He had passed her with a bow, and a few yards further on had seen
the Chinaman. He thought nothing of it; but one evening on his way home, when
night had already fallen, he passed two people walking very close together.
Hearing his footstep, they separated quickly, and though he could not see well
in the darkness he was almost certain they were Cacilie and Herr Sung. Their
rapid movement apart suggested that they had been walking arm in arm. Philip
was puzzled and surprised. He had never paid much attention to Fraulein
Cacilie. She was a plain girl, with a square face and blunt features. She could
not have been more than sixteen, since she still wore her long fair hair in a
plait. That evening at supper he looked at her curiously; and, though of late
she had talked little at meals, she addressed him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where did you go for your walk today, Herr Carey?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I walked up towards the Konigstuhl.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t go out,&rdquo; she volunteered. &ldquo;I had a
headache.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Chinaman, who sat next to her, turned round.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s better
now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fraulein Cacilie was evidently uneasy, for she spoke again to Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you meet many people on the way?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip could not help reddening when he told a downright lie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t think I saw a living soul.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He fancied that a look of relief passed across her eyes.
</p>

<p>
Soon, however, there could be no doubt that there was something between the
pair, and other people in the Frau Professor&rsquo;s house saw them lurking in
dark places. The elderly ladies who sat at the head of the table began to
discuss what was now a scandal. The Frau Professor was angry and harassed. She
had done her best to see nothing. The winter was at hand, and it was not as
easy a matter then as in the summer to keep her house full. Herr Sung was a
good customer: he had two rooms on the ground floor, and he drank a bottle of
Moselle at each meal. The Frau Professor charged him three marks a bottle and
made a good profit. None of her other guests drank wine, and some of them did
not even drink beer. Neither did she wish to lose Fraulein Cacilie, whose
parents were in business in South America and paid well for the Frau
Professor&rsquo;s motherly care; and she knew that if she wrote to the
girl&rsquo;s uncle, who lived in Berlin, he would immediately take her away.
The Frau Professor contented herself with giving them both severe looks at
table and, though she dared not be rude to the Chinaman, got a certain
satisfaction out of incivility to Cacilie. But the three elderly ladies were
not content. Two were widows, and one, a Dutchwoman, was a spinster of
masculine appearance; they paid the smallest possible sum for their pension,
and gave a good deal of trouble, but they were permanent and therefore had to
be put up with. They went to the Frau Professor and said that something must be
done; it was disgraceful, and the house was ceasing to be respectable. The Frau
Professor tried obstinacy, anger, tears, but the three old ladies routed her,
and with a sudden assumption of virtuous indignation she said that she would
put a stop to the whole thing.
</p>

<p>
After luncheon she took Cacilie into her bed-room and began to talk very
seriously to her; but to her amazement the girl adopted a brazen attitude; she
proposed to go about as she liked; and if she chose to walk with the Chinaman
she could not see it was anybody&rsquo;s business but her own. The Frau
Professor threatened to write to her uncle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then Onkel Heinrich will put me in a family in Berlin for the winter,
and that will be much nicer for me. And Herr Sung will come to Berlin
too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Frau Professor began to cry. The tears rolled down her coarse, red, fat
cheeks; and Cacilie laughed at her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That will mean three rooms empty all through the winter,&rdquo; she
said.
</p>

<p>
Then the Frau Professor tried another plan. She appealed to Fraulein
Cacilie&rsquo;s better nature: she was kind, sensible, tolerant; she treated
her no longer as a child, but as a grown woman. She said that it wouldn&rsquo;t
be so dreadful, but a Chinaman, with his yellow skin and flat nose, and his
little pig&rsquo;s eyes! That&rsquo;s what made it so horrible. It filled one
with disgust to think of it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bitte, bitte,&rdquo; said Cacilie, with a rapid intake of the breath.
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t listen to anything against him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not serious?&rdquo; gasped Frau Erlin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I love him. I love him. I love him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gott im Himmel!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Frau Professor stared at her with horrified surprise; she had thought it
was no more than naughtiness on the child&rsquo;s part, and innocent, folly.
but the passion in her voice revealed everything. Cacilie looked at her for a
moment with flaming eyes, and then with a shrug of her shoulders went out of
the room.
</p>

<p>
Frau Erlin kept the details of the interview to herself, and a day or two later
altered the arrangement of the table. She asked Herr Sung if he would not come
and sit at her end, and he with his unfailing politeness accepted with
alacrity. Cacilie took the change indifferently. But as if the discovery that
the relations between them were known to the whole household made them more
shameless, they made no secret now of their walks together, and every afternoon
quite openly set out to wander about the hills. It was plain that they did not
care what was said of them. At last even the placidity of Professor Erlin was
moved, and he insisted that his wife should speak to the Chinaman. She took him
aside in his turn and expostulated; he was ruining the girl&rsquo;s reputation,
he was doing harm to the house, he must see how wrong and wicked his conduct
was; but she was met with smiling denials; Herr Sung did not know what she was
talking about, he was not paying any attention to Fraulein Cacilie, he never
walked with her; it was all untrue, every word of it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ach, Herr Sung, how can you say such things? You&rsquo;ve been seen
again and again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re mistaken. It&rsquo;s untrue.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked at her with an unceasing smile, which showed his even, little white
teeth. He was quite calm. He denied everything. He denied with bland
effrontery. At last the Frau Professor lost her temper and said the girl had
confessed she loved him. He was not moved. He continued to smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense! Nonsense! It&rsquo;s all untrue.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She could get nothing out of him. The weather grew very bad; there was snow and
frost, and then a thaw with a long succession of cheerless days, on which
walking was a poor amusement. One evening when Philip had just finished his
German lesson with the Herr Professor and was standing for a moment in the
drawing-room, talking to Frau Erlin, Anna came quickly in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mamma, where is Cacilie?&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose she&rsquo;s in her room.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no light in it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Frau Professor gave an exclamation, and she looked at her daughter in
dismay. The thought which was in Anna&rsquo;s head had flashed across hers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ring for Emil,&rdquo; she said hoarsely.
</p>

<p>
This was the stupid lout who waited at table and did most of the housework. He
came in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Emil, go down to Herr Sung&rsquo;s room and enter without knocking. If
anyone is there say you came in to see about the stove.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
No sign of astonishment appeared on Emil&rsquo;s phlegmatic face.
</p>

<p>
He went slowly downstairs. The Frau Professor and Anna left the door open and
listened. Presently they heard Emil come up again, and they called him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Was anyone there?&rdquo; asked the Frau Professor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Herr Sung was there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Was he alone?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The beginning of a cunning smile narrowed his mouth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Fraulein Cacilie was there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s disgraceful,&rdquo; cried the Frau Professor.
</p>

<p>
Now he smiled broadly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fraulein Cacilie is there every evening. She spends hours at a time
there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Frau Professor began to wring her hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, how abominable! But why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was no business of mine,&rdquo; he answered, slowly shrugging his
shoulders.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose they paid you well. Go away. Go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He lurched clumsily to the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They must go away, mamma,&rdquo; said Anna.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And who is going to pay the rent? And the taxes are falling due.
It&rsquo;s all very well for you to say they must go away. If they go away I
can&rsquo;t pay the bills.&rdquo; She turned to Philip, with tears streaming
down her face. &ldquo;Ach, Herr Carey, you will not say what you have heard. If
Fraulein Forster&mdash;&rdquo; this was the Dutch spinster&mdash;&ldquo;if
Fraulein Forster knew she would leave at once. And if they all go we must close
the house. I cannot afford to keep it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course I won&rsquo;t say anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If she stays, I will not speak to her,&rdquo; said Anna.
</p>

<p>
That evening at supper Fraulein Cacilie, redder than usual, with a look of
obstinacy on her face, took her place punctually; but Herr Sung did not appear,
and for a while Philip thought he was going to shirk the ordeal. At last he
came, very smiling, his little eyes dancing with the apologies he made for his
late arrival. He insisted as usual on pouring out the Frau Professor a glass of
his Moselle, and he offered a glass to Fraulein Forster. The room was very hot,
for the stove had been alight all day and the windows were seldom opened. Emil
blundered about, but succeeded somehow in serving everyone quickly and with
order. The three old ladies sat in silence, visibly disapproving: the Frau
Professor had scarcely recovered from her tears; her husband was silent and
oppressed. Conversation languished. It seemed to Philip that there was
something dreadful in that gathering which he had sat with so often; they
looked different under the light of the two hanging lamps from what they had
ever looked before; he was vaguely uneasy. Once he caught Cacilie&rsquo;s eye,
and he thought she looked at him with hatred and contempt. The room was
stifling. It was as though the beastly passion of that pair troubled them all;
there was a feeling of Oriental depravity; a faint savour of joss-sticks, a
mystery of hidden vices, seemed to make their breath heavy. Philip could feel
the beating of the arteries in his forehead. He could not understand what
strange emotion distracted him; he seemed to feel something infinitely
attractive, and yet he was repelled and horrified.
</p>

<p>
For several days things went on. The air was sickly with the unnatural passion
which all felt about them, and the nerves of the little household seemed to
grow exasperated. Only Herr Sung remained unaffected; he was no less smiling,
affable, and polite than he had been before: one could not tell whether his
manner was a triumph of civilisation or an expression of contempt on the part
of the Oriental for the vanquished West. Cacilie was flaunting and cynical. At
last even the Frau Professor could bear the position no longer. Suddenly panic
seized her; for Professor Erlin with brutal frankness had suggested the
possible consequences of an intrigue which was now manifest to everyone, and
she saw her good name in Heidelberg and the repute of her house ruined by a
scandal which could not possibly be hidden. For some reason, blinded perhaps by
her interests, this possibility had never occurred to her; and now, her wits
muddled by a terrible fear, she could hardly be prevented from turning the girl
out of the house at once. It was due to Anna&rsquo;s good sense that a cautious
letter was written to the uncle in Berlin suggesting that Cacilie should be
taken away.
</p>

<p>
But having made up her mind to lose the two lodgers, the Frau Professor could
not resist the satisfaction of giving rein to the ill-temper she had curbed so
long. She was free now to say anything she liked to Cacilie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have written to your uncle, Cacilie, to take you away. I cannot have
you in my house any longer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her little round eyes sparkled when she noticed the sudden whiteness of the
girl&rsquo;s face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re shameless. Shameless,&rdquo; she went on.
</p>

<p>
She called her foul names.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did you say to my uncle Heinrich, Frau Professor?&rdquo; the girl
asked, suddenly falling from her attitude of flaunting independence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll tell you himself. I expect to get a letter from him
tomorrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Next day, in order to make the humiliation more public, at supper she called
down the table to Cacilie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have had a letter from your uncle, Cacilie. You are to pack your
things tonight, and we will put you in the train tomorrow morning. He will meet
you himself in Berlin at the Central Bahnhof.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very good, Frau Professor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Herr Sung smiled in the Frau Professor&rsquo;s eyes, and notwithstanding her
protests insisted on pouring out a glass of wine for her. The Frau Professor
ate her supper with a good appetite. But she had triumphed unwisely. Just
before going to bed she called the servant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Emil, if Fraulein Cacilie&rsquo;s box is ready you had better take it
downstairs tonight. The porter will fetch it before breakfast.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The servant went away and in a moment came back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fraulein Cacilie is not in her room, and her bag has gone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With a cry the Frau Professor hurried along: the box was on the floor, strapped
and locked; but there was no bag, and neither hat nor cloak. The dressing-table
was empty. Breathing heavily, the Frau Professor ran downstairs to the
Chinaman&rsquo;s rooms, she had not moved so quickly for twenty years, and Emil
called out after her to beware she did not fall; she did not trouble to knock,
but burst in. The rooms were empty. The luggage had gone, and the door into the
garden, still open, showed how it had been got away. In an envelope on the
table were notes for the money due on the month&rsquo;s board and an
approximate sum for extras. Groaning, suddenly overcome by her haste, the Frau
Professor sank obesely on to a sofa. There could be no doubt. The pair had gone
off together. Emil remained stolid and unmoved.

<p>
Hayward, after saying for a month that he was going South next day and delaying
from week to week out of inability to make up his mind to the bother of packing
and the tedium of a journey, had at last been driven off just before Christmas
by the preparations for that festival. He could not support the thought of a
Teutonic merry-making. It gave him goose-flesh to think of the season&rsquo;s
aggressive cheerfulness, and in his desire to avoid the obvious he determined
to travel on Christmas Eve.
</p>

<p>
Philip was not sorry to see him off, for he was a downright person and it
irritated him that anybody should not know his own mind. Though much under
Hayward&rsquo;s influence, he would not grant that indecision pointed to a
charming sensitiveness; and he resented the shadow of a sneer with which
Hayward looked upon his straight ways. They corresponded. Hayward was an
admirable letter-writer, and knowing his talent took pains with his letters.
His temperament was receptive to the beautiful influences with which he came in
contact, and he was able in his letters from Rome to put a subtle fragrance of
Italy. He thought the city of the ancient Romans a little vulgar, finding
distinction only in the decadence of the Empire; but the Rome of the Popes
appealed to his sympathy, and in his chosen words, quite exquisitely, there
appeared a rococo beauty. He wrote of old church music and the Alban Hills, and
of the languor of incense and the charm of the streets by night, in the rain,
when the pavements shone and the light of the street lamps was mysterious.
Perhaps he repeated these admirable letters to various friends. He did not know
what a troubling effect they had upon Philip; they seemed to make his life very
humdrum. With the spring Hayward grew dithyrambic. He proposed that Philip
should come down to Italy. He was wasting his time at Heidelberg. The Germans
were gross and life there was common; how could the soul come to her own in
that prim landscape? In Tuscany the spring was scattering flowers through the
land, and Philip was nineteen; let him come and they could wander through the
mountain towns of Umbria. Their names sang in Philip&rsquo;s heart. And Cacilie
too, with her lover, had gone to Italy. When he thought of them Philip was
seized with a restlessness he could not account for. He cursed his fate because
he had no money to travel, and he knew his uncle would not send him more than
the fifteen pounds a month which had been agreed upon. He had not managed his
allowance very well. His pension and the price of his lessons left him very
little over, and he had found going about with Hayward expensive. Hayward had
often suggested excursions, a visit to the play, or a bottle of wine, when
Philip had come to the end of his month&rsquo;s money; and with the folly of
his age he had been unwilling to confess he could not afford an extravagance.
</p>

<p>
Luckily Hayward&rsquo;s letters came seldom, and in the intervals Philip
settled down again to his industrious life. He had matriculated at the
university and attended one or two courses of lectures. Kuno Fischer was then
at the height of his fame and during the winter had been lecturing brilliantly
on Schopenhauer. It was Philip&rsquo;s introduction to philosophy. He had a
practical mind and moved uneasily amid the abstract; but he found an unexpected
fascination in listening to metaphysical disquisitions; they made him
breathless; it was a little like watching a tight-rope dancer doing perilous
feats over an abyss; but it was very exciting. The pessimism of the subject
attracted his youth; and he believed that the world he was about to enter was a
place of pitiless woe and of darkness. That made him none the less eager to
enter it; and when, in due course, Mrs. Carey, acting as the correspondent for
his guardian&rsquo;s views, suggested that it was time for him to come back to
England, he agreed with enthusiasm. He must make up his mind now what he meant
to do. If he left Heidelberg at the end of July they could talk things over
during August, and it would be a good time to make arrangements.
</p>

<p>
The date of his departure was settled, and Mrs. Carey wrote to him again. She
reminded him of Miss Wilkinson, through whose kindness he had gone to Frau
Erlin&rsquo;s house at Heidelberg, and told him that she had arranged to spend
a few weeks with them at Blackstable. She would be crossing from Flushing on
such and such a day, and if he travelled at the same time he could look after
her and come on to Blackstable in her company. Philip&rsquo;s shyness
immediately made him write to say that he could not leave till a day or two
afterwards. He pictured himself looking out for Miss Wilkinson, the
embarrassment of going up to her and asking if it were she (and he might so
easily address the wrong person and be snubbed), and then the difficulty of
knowing whether in the train he ought to talk to her or whether he could ignore
her and read his book.
</p>

<p>
At last he left Heidelberg. For three months he had been thinking of nothing
but the future; and he went without regret. He never knew that he had been
happy there. Fraulein Anna gave him a copy of Der Trompeter von Sackingen and
in return he presented her with a volume of William Morris. Very wisely neither
of them ever read the other&rsquo;s present.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>XXXII</h2>

<p>
Philip was surprised when he saw his uncle and aunt. He had never noticed
before that they were quite old people. The Vicar received him with his usual,
not unamiable indifference. He was a little stouter, a little balder, a little
grayer. Philip saw how insignificant he was. His face was weak and
self-indulgent. Aunt Louisa took him in her arms and kissed him; and tears of
happiness flowed down her cheeks. Philip was touched and embarrassed; he had
not known with what a hungry love she cared for him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, the time has seemed long since you&rsquo;ve been away,
Philip,&rdquo; she cried.
</p>

<p>
She stroked his hands and looked into his face with glad eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve grown. You&rsquo;re quite a man now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a very small moustache on his upper lip. He had bought a razor and
now and then with infinite care shaved the down off his smooth chin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been so lonely without you.&rdquo; And then shyly, with a
little break in her voice, she asked: &ldquo;You are glad to come back to your
home, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, rather.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She was so thin that she seemed almost transparent, the arms she put round his
neck were frail bones that reminded you of chicken bones, and her faded face
was oh! so wrinkled. The gray curls which she still wore in the fashion of her
youth gave her a queer, pathetic look; and her little withered body was like an
autumn leaf, you felt it might be blown away by the first sharp wind. Philip
realised that they had done with life, these two quiet little people: they
belonged to a past generation, and they were waiting there patiently, rather
stupidly, for death; and he, in his vigour and his youth, thirsting for
excitement and adventure, was appalled at the waste. They had done nothing, and
when they went it would be just as if they had never been. He felt a great pity
for Aunt Louisa, and he loved her suddenly because she loved him.
</p>

<p>
Then Miss Wilkinson, who had kept discreetly out of the way till the Careys had
had a chance of welcoming their nephew, came into the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is Miss Wilkinson, Philip,&rdquo; said Mrs. Carey.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The prodigal has returned,&rdquo; she said, holding out her hand.
&ldquo;I have brought a rose for the prodigal&rsquo;s buttonhole.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With a gay smile she pinned to Philip&rsquo;s coat the flower she had just
picked in the garden. He blushed and felt foolish. He knew that Miss Wilkinson
was the daughter of his Uncle William&rsquo;s last rector, and he had a wide
acquaintance with the daughters of clergymen. They wore ill-cut clothes and
stout boots. They were generally dressed in black, for in Philip&rsquo;s early
years at Blackstable homespuns had not reached East Anglia, and the ladies of
the clergy did not favour colours. Their hair was done very untidily, and they
smelt aggressively of starched linen. They considered the feminine graces
unbecoming and looked the same whether they were old or young. They bore their
religion arrogantly. The closeness of their connection with the church made
them adopt a slightly dictatorial attitude to the rest of mankind.
</p>

<p>
Miss Wilkinson was very different. She wore a white muslin gown stamped with
gay little bunches of flowers, and pointed, high-heeled shoes, with open-work
stockings. To Philip&rsquo;s inexperience it seemed that she was wonderfully
dressed; he did not see that her frock was cheap and showy. Her hair was
elaborately dressed, with a neat curl in the middle of the forehead: it was
very black, shiny and hard, and it looked as though it could never be in the
least disarranged. She had large black eyes and her nose was slightly aquiline;
in profile she had somewhat the look of a bird of prey, but full face she was
prepossessing. She smiled a great deal, but her mouth was large and when she
smiled she tried to hide her teeth, which were big and rather yellow. But what
embarrassed Philip most was that she was heavily powdered: he had very strict
views on feminine behaviour and did not think a lady ever powdered; but of
course Miss Wilkinson was a lady because she was a clergyman&rsquo;s daughter,
and a clergyman was a gentleman.
</p>

<p>
Philip made up his mind to dislike her thoroughly. She spoke with a slight
French accent; and he did not know why she should, since she had been born and
bred in the heart of England. He thought her smile affected, and the coy
sprightliness of her manner irritated him. For two or three days he remained
silent and hostile, but Miss Wilkinson apparently did not notice it. She was
very affable. She addressed her conversation almost exclusively to him, and
there was something flattering in the way she appealed constantly to his sane
judgment. She made him laugh too, and Philip could never resist people who
amused him: he had a gift now and then of saying neat things; and it was
pleasant to have an appreciative listener. Neither the Vicar nor Mrs. Carey had
a sense of humour, and they never laughed at anything he said. As he grew used
to Miss Wilkinson, and his shyness left him, he began to like her better; he
found the French accent picturesque; and at a garden party which the doctor
gave she was very much better dressed than anyone else. She wore a blue foulard
with large white spots, and Philip was tickled at the sensation it caused.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain they think you&rsquo;re no better than you should
be,&rdquo; he told her, laughing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the dream of my life to be taken for an abandoned
hussy,&rdquo; she answered.
</p>

<p>
One day when Miss Wilkinson was in her room he asked Aunt Louisa how old she
was.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my dear, you should never ask a lady&rsquo;s age; but she&rsquo;s
certainly too old for you to marry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Vicar gave his slow, obese smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s no chicken, Louisa,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She was nearly
grown up when we were in Lincolnshire, and that was twenty years ago. She wore
a pigtail hanging down her back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She may not have been more than ten,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She was older than that,&rdquo; said Aunt Louisa.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think she was near twenty,&rdquo; said the Vicar.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, William. Sixteen or seventeen at the outside.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That would make her well over thirty,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
At that moment Miss Wilkinson tripped downstairs, singing a song by Benjamin
Goddard. She had put her hat on, for she and Philip were going for a walk, and
she held out her hand for him to button her glove. He did it awkwardly. He felt
embarrassed but gallant. Conversation went easily between them now, and as they
strolled along they talked of all manner of things. She told Philip about
Berlin, and he told her of his year in Heidelberg. As he spoke, things which
had appeared of no importance gained a new interest: he described the people at
Frau Erlin&rsquo;s house; and to the conversations between Hayward and Weeks,
which at the time seemed so significant, he gave a little twist, so that they
looked absurd. He was flattered at Miss Wilkinson&rsquo;s laughter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite frightened of you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
so sarcastic.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then she asked him playfully whether he had not had any love affairs at
Heidelberg. Without thinking, he frankly answered that he had not; but she
refused to believe him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How secretive you are!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;At your age is it
likely?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He blushed and laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You want to know too much,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, I thought so,&rdquo; she laughed triumphantly. &ldquo;Look at him
blushing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was pleased that she should think he had been a sad dog, and he changed the
conversation so as to make her believe he had all sorts of romantic things to
conceal. He was angry with himself that he had not. There had been no
opportunity.
</p>

<p>
Miss Wilkinson was dissatisfied with her lot. She resented having to earn her
living and told Philip a long story of an uncle of her mother&rsquo;s, who had
been expected to leave her a fortune but had married his cook and changed his
will. She hinted at the luxury of her home and compared her life in
Lincolnshire, with horses to ride and carriages to drive in, with the mean
dependence of her present state. Philip was a little puzzled when he mentioned
this afterwards to Aunt Louisa, and she told him that when she knew the
Wilkinsons they had never had anything more than a pony and a dog-cart; Aunt
Louisa had heard of the rich uncle, but as he was married and had children
before Emily was born she could never have had much hope of inheriting his
fortune. Miss Wilkinson had little good to say of Berlin, where she was now in
a situation. She complained of the vulgarity of German life, and compared it
bitterly with the brilliance of Paris, where she had spent a number of years.
She did not say how many. She had been governess in the family of a fashionable
portrait-painter, who had married a Jewish wife of means, and in their house
she had met many distinguished people. She dazzled Philip with their names.
Actors from the Comedie Francaise had come to the house frequently, and
Coquelin, sitting next her at dinner, had told her he had never met a foreigner
who spoke such perfect French. Alphonse Daudet had come also, and he had given
her a copy of Sappho: he had promised to write her name in it, but she had
forgotten to remind him. She treasured the volume none the less and she would
lend it to Philip. Then there was Maupassant. Miss Wilkinson with a rippling
laugh looked at Philip knowingly. What a man, but what a writer! Hayward had
talked of Maupassant, and his reputation was not unknown to Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did he make love to you?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
The words seemed to stick funnily in his throat, but he asked them
nevertheless. He liked Miss Wilkinson very much now, and was thrilled by her
conversation, but he could not imagine anyone making love to her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a question!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Poor Guy, he made love to
every woman he met. It was a habit that he could not break himself of.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She sighed a little, and seemed to look back tenderly on the past.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He was a charming man,&rdquo; she murmured.
</p>

<p>
A greater experience than Philip&rsquo;s would have guessed from these words
the probabilities of the encounter: the distinguished writer invited to
luncheon en famille, the governess coming in sedately with the two tall girls
she was teaching; the introduction:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Notre Miss Anglaise.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mademoiselle.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And the luncheon during which the Miss Anglaise sat silent while the
distinguished writer talked to his host and hostess.
</p>

<p>
But to Philip her words called up much more romantic fancies.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do tell me all about him,&rdquo; he said excitedly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to tell,&rdquo; she said truthfully, but in such a
manner as to convey that three volumes would scarcely have contained the lurid
facts. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t be curious.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She began to talk of Paris. She loved the boulevards and the Bois. There was
grace in every street, and the trees in the Champs Elysees had a distinction
which trees had not elsewhere. They were sitting on a stile now by the
high-road, and Miss Wilkinson looked with disdain upon the stately elms in
front of them. And the theatres: the plays were brilliant, and the acting was
incomparable. She often went with Madame Foyot, the mother of the girls she was
educating, when she was trying on clothes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, what a misery to be poor!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;These beautiful
things, it&rsquo;s only in Paris they know how to dress, and not to be able to
afford them! Poor Madame Foyot, she had no figure. Sometimes the dressmaker
used to whisper to me: &lsquo;Ah, Mademoiselle, if she only had your
figure.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip noticed then that Miss Wilkinson had a robust form and was proud of it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Men are so stupid in England. They only think of the face. The French,
who are a nation of lovers, know how much more important the figure is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip had never thought of such things before, but he observed now that Miss
Wilkinson&rsquo;s ankles were thick and ungainly. He withdrew his eyes quickly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You should go to France. Why don&rsquo;t you go to Paris for a year? You
would learn French, and it would&mdash;deniaiser you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
She laughed slyly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must look it out in the dictionary. Englishmen do not know how to
treat women. They are so shy. Shyness is ridiculous in a man. They don&rsquo;t
know how to make love. They can&rsquo;t even tell a woman she is charming
without looking foolish.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip felt himself absurd. Miss Wilkinson evidently expected him to behave
very differently; and he would have been delighted to say gallant and witty
things, but they never occurred to him; and when they did he was too much
afraid of making a fool of himself to say them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I love Paris,&rdquo; sighed Miss Wilkinson. &ldquo;But I had to go
to Berlin. I was with the Foyots till the girls married, and then I could get
nothing to do, and I had the chance of this post in Berlin. They&rsquo;re
relations of Madame Foyot, and I accepted. I had a tiny apartment in the Rue
Breda, on the cinquieme: it wasn&rsquo;t at all respectable. You know about the
Rue Breda&mdash;ces dames, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip nodded, not knowing at all what she meant, but vaguely suspecting, and
anxious she should not think him too ignorant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t care. Je suis libre, n&rsquo;est-ce pas?&rdquo; She
was very fond of speaking French, which indeed she spoke well. &ldquo;Once I
had such a curious adventure there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She paused a little and Philip pressed her to tell it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t tell me yours in Heidelberg,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They were so unadventurous,&rdquo; he retorted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what Mrs. Carey would say if she knew the sort of
things we talk about together.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t imagine I shall tell her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you promise?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When he had done this, she told him how an art-student who had a room on the
floor above her&mdash;but she interrupted herself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go in for art? You paint so prettily.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not well enough for that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is for others to judge. Je m&rsquo;y connais, and I believe you
have the making of a great artist.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see Uncle William&rsquo;s face if I suddenly told him I
wanted to go to Paris and study art?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re your own master, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to put me off. Please go on with the story.&rdquo;
Miss Wilkinson, with a little laugh, went on. The art-student had passed her
several times on the stairs, and she had paid no particular attention. She saw
that he had fine eyes, and he took off his hat very politely. And one day she
found a letter slipped under her door. It was from him. He told her that he had
adored her for months, and that he waited about the stairs for her to pass. Oh,
it was a charming letter! Of course she did not reply, but what woman could
help being flattered? And next day there was another letter! It was wonderful,
passionate, and touching. When next she met him on the stairs she did not know
which way to look. And every day the letters came, and now he begged her to see
him. He said he would come in the evening, vers neuf heures, and she did not
know what to do. Of course it was impossible, and he might ring and ring, but
she would never open the door; and then while she was waiting for the tinkling
of the bell, all nerves, suddenly he stood before her. She had forgotten to
shut the door when she came in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;C&rsquo;etait une fatalite.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what happened then?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is the end of the story,&rdquo; she replied, with a ripple of
laughter.
</p>

<p>
Philip was silent for a moment. His heart beat quickly, and strange emotions
seemed to be hustling one another in his heart. He saw the dark staircase and
the chance meetings, and he admired the boldness of the letters&mdash;oh, he
would never have dared to do that&mdash;and then the silent, almost mysterious
entrance. It seemed to him the very soul of romance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What was he like?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he was handsome. Charmant garcon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know him still?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip felt a slight feeling of irritation as he asked this.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He treated me abominably. Men are always the same. You&rsquo;re
heartless, all of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; said Philip, not without
embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let us go home,&rdquo; said Miss Wilkinson.
</p>

<h2>XXXIII</h2>

<p>
Philip could not get Miss Wilkinson&rsquo;s story out of his head. It was clear
enough what she meant even though she cut it short, and he was a little
shocked. That sort of thing was all very well for married women, he had read
enough French novels to know that in France it was indeed the rule, but Miss
Wilkinson was English and unmarried; her father was a clergyman. Then it struck
him that the art-student probably was neither the first nor the last of her
lovers, and he gasped: he had never looked upon Miss Wilkinson like that; it
seemed incredible that anyone should make love to her. In his ingenuousness he
doubted her story as little as he doubted what he read in books, and he was
angry that such wonderful things never happened to him. It was humiliating that
if Miss Wilkinson insisted upon his telling her of his adventures in Heidelberg
he would have nothing to tell. It was true that he had some power of invention,
but he was not sure whether he could persuade her that he was steeped in vice;
women were full of intuition, he had read that, and she might easily discover
that he was fibbing. He blushed scarlet as he thought of her laughing up her
sleeve.
</p>

<p>
Miss Wilkinson played the piano and sang in a rather tired voice; but her
songs, Massenet, Benjamin Goddard, and Augusta Holmes, were new to Philip; and
together they spent many hours at the piano. One day she wondered if he had a
voice and insisted on trying it. She told him he had a pleasant baritone and
offered to give him lessons. At first with his usual bashfulness he refused,
but she insisted, and then every morning at a convenient time after breakfast
she gave him an hour&rsquo;s lesson. She had a natural gift for teaching, and
it was clear that she was an excellent governess. She had method and firmness.
Though her French accent was so much part of her that it remained, all the
mellifluousness of her manner left her when she was engaged in teaching. She
put up with no nonsense. Her voice became a little peremptory, and
instinctively she suppressed inattention and corrected slovenliness. She knew
what she was about and put Philip to scales and exercises.
</p>

<p>
When the lesson was over she resumed without effort her seductive smiles, her
voice became again soft and winning, but Philip could not so easily put away
the pupil as she the pedagogue; and this impression convicted with the feelings
her stories had aroused in him. He looked at her more narrowly. He liked her
much better in the evening than in the morning. In the morning she was rather
lined and the skin of her neck was just a little rough. He wished she would
hide it, but the weather was very warm just then and she wore blouses which
were cut low. She was very fond of white; in the morning it did not suit her.
At night she often looked very attractive, she put on a gown which was almost a
dinner dress, and she wore a chain of garnets round her neck; the lace about
her bosom and at her elbows gave her a pleasant softness, and the scent she
wore (at Blackstable no one used anything but Eau de Cologne, and that only on
Sundays or when suffering from a sick headache) was troubling and exotic. She
really looked very young then.
</p>

<p>
Philip was much exercised over her age. He added twenty and seventeen together,
and could not bring them to a satisfactory total. He asked Aunt Louisa more
than once why she thought Miss Wilkinson was thirty-seven: she didn&rsquo;t
look more than thirty, and everyone knew that foreigners aged more rapidly than
English women; Miss Wilkinson had lived so long abroad that she might almost be
called a foreigner. He personally wouldn&rsquo;t have thought her more than
twenty-six.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s more than that,&rdquo; said Aunt Louisa.
</p>

<p>
Philip did not believe in the accuracy of the Careys&rsquo; statements. All
they distinctly remembered was that Miss Wilkinson had not got her hair up the
last time they saw her in Lincolnshire. Well, she might have been twelve then:
it was so long ago and the Vicar was always so unreliable. They said it was
twenty years ago, but people used round figures, and it was just as likely to
be eighteen years, or seventeen. Seventeen and twelve were only twenty-nine,
and hang it all, that wasn&rsquo;t old, was it? Cleopatra was forty-eight when
Antony threw away the world for her sake.
</p>

<p>
It was a fine summer. Day after day was hot and cloudless; but the heat was
tempered by the neighbourhood of the sea, and there was a pleasant exhilaration
in the air, so that one was excited and not oppressed by the August sunshine.
There was a pond in the garden in which a fountain played; water lilies grew in
it and gold fish sunned themselves on the surface. Philip and Miss Wilkinson
used to take rugs and cushions there after dinner and lie on the lawn in the
shade of a tall hedge of roses. They talked and read all the afternoon. They
smoked cigarettes, which the Vicar did not allow in the house; he thought
smoking a disgusting habit, and used frequently to say that it was disgraceful
for anyone to grow a slave to a habit. He forgot that he was himself a slave to
afternoon tea.
</p>

<p>
One day Miss Wilkinson gave Philip La Vie de Boheme. She had found it by
accident when she was rummaging among the books in the Vicar&rsquo;s study. It
had been bought in a lot with something Mr. Carey wanted and had remained
undiscovered for ten years.
</p>

<p>
Philip began to read Murger&rsquo;s fascinating, ill-written, absurd
masterpiece, and fell at once under its spell. His soul danced with joy at that
picture of starvation which is so good-humoured, of squalor which is so
picturesque, of sordid love which is so romantic, of bathos which is so moving.
Rodolphe and Mimi, Musette and Schaunard! They wander through the gray streets
of the Latin Quarter, finding refuge now in one attic, now in another, in their
quaint costumes of Louis Philippe, with their tears and their smiles,
happy-go-lucky and reckless. Who can resist them? It is only when you return to
the book with a sounder judgment that you find how gross their pleasures were,
how vulgar their minds; and you feel the utter worthlessness, as artists and as
human beings, of that gay procession. Philip was enraptured.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish you were going to Paris instead of London?&rdquo;
asked Miss Wilkinson, smiling at his enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late now even if I did,&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
During the fortnight he had been back from Germany there had been much
discussion between himself and his uncle about his future. He had refused
definitely to go to Oxford, and now that there was no chance of his getting
scholarships even Mr. Carey came to the conclusion that he could not afford it.
His entire fortune had consisted of only two thousand pounds, and though it had
been invested in mortgages at five per cent, he had not been able to live on
the interest. It was now a little reduced. It would be absurd to spend two
hundred a year, the least he could live on at a university, for three years at
Oxford which would lead him no nearer to earning his living. He was anxious to
go straight to London. Mrs. Carey thought there were only four professions for
a gentleman, the Army, the Navy, the Law, and the Church. She had added
medicine because her brother-in-law practised it, but did not forget that in
her young days no one ever considered the doctor a gentleman. The first two
were out of the question, and Philip was firm in his refusal to be ordained.
Only the law remained. The local doctor had suggested that many gentlemen now
went in for engineering, but Mrs. Carey opposed the idea at once.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like Philip to go into trade,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, he must have a profession,&rdquo; answered the Vicar.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not make him a doctor like his father?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should hate it,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Carey was not sorry. The Bar seemed out of the question, since he was not
going to Oxford, for the Careys were under the impression that a degree was
still necessary for success in that calling; and finally it was suggested that
he should become articled to a solicitor. They wrote to the family lawyer,
Albert Nixon, who was co-executor with the Vicar of Blackstable for the late
Henry Carey&rsquo;s estate, and asked him whether he would take Philip. In a
day or two the answer came back that he had not a vacancy, and was very much
opposed to the whole scheme; the profession was greatly overcrowded, and
without capital or connections a man had small chance of becoming more than a
managing clerk; he suggested, however, that Philip should become a chartered
accountant. Neither the Vicar nor his wife knew in the least what this was, and
Philip had never heard of anyone being a chartered accountant; but another
letter from the solicitor explained that the growth of modern businesses and
the increase of companies had led to the formation of many firms of accountants
to examine the books and put into the financial affairs of their clients an
order which old-fashioned methods had lacked. Some years before a Royal Charter
had been obtained, and the profession was becoming every year more respectable,
lucrative, and important. The chartered accountants whom Albert Nixon had
employed for thirty years happened to have a vacancy for an articled pupil, and
would take Philip for a fee of three hundred pounds. Half of this would be
returned during the five years the articles lasted in the form of salary. The
prospect was not exciting, but Philip felt that he must decide on something,
and the thought of living in London over-balanced the slight shrinking he felt.
The Vicar of Blackstable wrote to ask Mr. Nixon whether it was a profession
suited to a gentleman; and Mr. Nixon replied that, since the Charter, men were
going into it who had been to public schools and a university; moreover, if
Philip disliked the work and after a year wished to leave, Herbert Carter, for
that was the accountant&rsquo;s name, would return half the money paid for the
articles. This settled it, and it was arranged that Philip should start work on
the fifteenth of September.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have a full month before me,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And then you go to freedom and I to bondage,&rdquo; returned Miss
Wilkinson.
</p>

<p>
Her holidays were to last six weeks, and she would be leaving Blackstable only
a day or two before Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder if we shall ever meet again,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t speak in that practical way. I never knew anyone so
unsentimental.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip reddened. He was afraid that Miss Wilkinson would think him a milksop:
after all she was a young woman, sometimes quite pretty, and he was getting on
for twenty; it was absurd that they should talk of nothing but art and
literature. He ought to make love to her. They had talked a good deal of love.
There was the art-student in the Rue Breda, and then there was the painter in
whose family she had lived so long in Paris: he had asked her to sit for him,
and had started to make love to her so violently that she was forced to invent
excuses not to sit to him again. It was clear enough that Miss Wilkinson was
used to attentions of that sort. She looked very nice now in a large straw hat:
it was hot that afternoon, the hottest day they had had, and beads of sweat
stood in a line on her upper lip. He called to mind Fraulein Cacilie and Herr
Sung. He had never thought of Cacilie in an amorous way, she was exceedingly
plain; but now, looking back, the affair seemed very romantic. He had a chance
of romance too. Miss Wilkinson was practically French, and that added zest to a
possible adventure. When he thought of it at night in bed, or when he sat by
himself in the garden reading a book, he was thrilled by it; but when he saw
Miss Wilkinson it seemed less picturesque.
</p>

<p>
At all events, after what she had told him, she would not be surprised if he
made love to her. He had a feeling that she must think it odd of him to make no
sign: perhaps it was only his fancy, but once or twice in the last day or two
he had imagined that there was a suspicion of contempt in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A penny for your thoughts,&rdquo; said Miss Wilkinson, looking at him
with a smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to tell you,&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
He was thinking that he ought to kiss her there and then. He wondered if she
expected him to do it; but after all he didn&rsquo;t see how he could without
any preliminary business at all. She would just think him mad, or she might
slap his face; and perhaps she would complain to his uncle. He wondered how
Herr Sung had started with Fraulein Cacilie. It would be beastly if she told
his uncle: he knew what his uncle was, he would tell the doctor and Josiah
Graves; and he would look a perfect fool. Aunt Louisa kept on saying that Miss
Wilkinson was thirty-seven if she was a day; he shuddered at the thought of the
ridicule he would be exposed to; they would say she was old enough to be his
mother.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Twopence for your thoughts,&rdquo; smiled Miss Wilkinson.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was thinking about you,&rdquo; he answered boldly.
</p>

<p>
That at all events committed him to nothing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What were you thinking?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, now you want to know too much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Naughty boy!&rdquo; said Miss Wilkinson.
</p>

<p>
There it was again! Whenever he had succeeded in working himself up she said
something which reminded him of the governess. She called him playfully a
naughty boy when he did not sing his exercises to her satisfaction. This time
he grew quite sulky.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t treat me as if I were a child.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you cross?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She put out her hand and he took it. Once or twice lately when they shook hands
at night he had fancied she slightly pressed his hand, but this time there was
no doubt about it.
</p>

<p>
He did not quite know what he ought to say next. Here at last was his chance of
an adventure, and he would be a fool not to take it; but it was a little
ordinary, and he had expected more glamour. He had read many descriptions of
love, and he felt in himself none of that uprush of emotion which novelists
described; he was not carried off his feet in wave upon wave of passion; nor
was Miss Wilkinson the ideal: he had often pictured to himself the great violet
eyes and the alabaster skin of some lovely girl, and he had thought of himself
burying his face in the rippling masses of her auburn hair. He could not
imagine himself burying his face in Miss Wilkinson&rsquo;s hair, it always
struck him as a little sticky. All the same it would be very satisfactory to
have an intrigue, and he thrilled with the legitimate pride he would enjoy in
his conquest. He owed it to himself to seduce her. He made up his mind to kiss
Miss Wilkinson; not then, but in the evening; it would be easier in the dark,
and after he had kissed her the rest would follow. He would kiss her that very
evening. He swore an oath to that effect.
</p>

<p>
He laid his plans. After supper he suggested that they should take a stroll in
the garden. Miss Wilkinson accepted, and they sauntered side by side. Philip
was very nervous. He did not know why, but the conversation would not lead in
the right direction; he had decided that the first thing to do was to put his
arm round her waist; but he could not suddenly put his arm round her waist when
she was talking of the regatta which was to be held next week. He led her
artfully into the darkest parts of the garden, but having arrived there his
courage failed him. They sat on a bench, and he had really made up his mind
that here was his opportunity when Miss Wilkinson said she was sure there were
earwigs and insisted on moving. They walked round the garden once more, and
Philip promised himself he would take the plunge before they arrived at that
bench again; but as they passed the house, they saw Mrs. Carey standing at the
door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you young people better come in? I&rsquo;m sure the night
air isn&rsquo;t good for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps we had better go in,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want you to catch cold.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He said it with a sigh of relief. He could attempt nothing more that night. But
afterwards, when he was alone in his room, he was furious with himself. He had
been a perfect fool. He was certain that Miss Wilkinson expected him to kiss
her, otherwise she wouldn&rsquo;t have come into the garden. She was always
saying that only Frenchmen knew how to treat women. Philip had read French
novels. If he had been a Frenchman he would have seized her in his arms and
told her passionately that he adored her; he would have pressed his lips on her
nuque. He did not know why Frenchmen always kissed ladies on the nuque. He did
not himself see anything so very attractive in the nape of the neck. Of course
it was much easier for Frenchmen to do these things; the language was such an
aid; Philip could never help feeling that to say passionate things in English
sounded a little absurd. He wished now that he had never undertaken the siege
of Miss Wilkinson&rsquo;s virtue; the first fortnight had been so jolly, and
now he was wretched; but he was determined not to give in, he would never
respect himself again if he did, and he made up his mind irrevocably that the
next night he would kiss her without fail.
</p>

<p>
Next day when he got up he saw it was raining, and his first thought was that
they would not be able to go into the garden that evening. He was in high
spirits at breakfast. Miss Wilkinson sent Mary Ann in to say that she had a
headache and would remain in bed. She did not come down till tea-time, when she
appeared in a becoming wrapper and a pale face; but she was quite recovered by
supper, and the meal was very cheerful. After prayers she said she would go
straight to bed, and she kissed Mrs. Carey. Then she turned to Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I was just going to kiss you
too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
She laughed and held out her hand. She distinctly pressed his.
</p>

<p>
The following day there was not a cloud in the sky, and the garden was sweet
and fresh after the rain. Philip went down to the beach to bathe and when he
came home ate a magnificent dinner. They were having a tennis party at the
vicarage in the afternoon and Miss Wilkinson put on her best dress. She
certainly knew how to wear her clothes, and Philip could not help noticing how
elegant she looked beside the curate&rsquo;s wife and the doctor&rsquo;s
married daughter. There were two roses in her waistband. She sat in a garden
chair by the side of the lawn, holding a red parasol over herself, and the
light on her face was very becoming. Philip was fond of tennis. He served well
and as he ran clumsily played close to the net: notwithstanding his club-foot
he was quick, and it was difficult to get a ball past him. He was pleased
because he won all his sets. At tea he lay down at Miss Wilkinson&rsquo;s feet,
hot and panting.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Flannels suit you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You look very nice this
afternoon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He blushed with delight.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can honestly return the compliment. You look perfectly
ravishing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She smiled and gave him a long look with her black eyes.
</p>

<p>
After supper he insisted that she should come out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you had enough exercise for one day?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be lovely in the garden tonight. The stars are all
out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was in high spirits.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you know, Mrs. Carey has been scolding me on your
account?&rdquo; said Miss Wilkinson, when they were sauntering through the
kitchen garden. &ldquo;She says I mustn&rsquo;t flirt with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you been flirting with me? I hadn&rsquo;t noticed it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She was only joking.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was very unkind of you to refuse to kiss me last night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you saw the look your uncle gave me when I said what I did!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Was that all that prevented you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I prefer to kiss people without witnesses.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There are no witnesses now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip put his arm round her waist and kissed her lips. She only laughed a
little and made no attempt to withdraw. It had come quite naturally. Philip was
very proud of himself. He said he would, and he had. It was the easiest thing
in the world. He wished he had done it before. He did it again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because I like it,&rdquo; she laughed.
</p>

<h2>XXXIV</h2>

<p>
Next day after dinner they took their rugs and cushions to the fountain, and
their books; but they did not read. Miss Wilkinson made herself comfortable and
she opened the red sun-shade. Philip was not at all shy now, but at first she
would not let him kiss her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was very wrong of me last night,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t sleep, I felt I&rsquo;d done so wrong.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you slept like a
top.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you think your uncle would say if he knew?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason why he should know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He leaned over her, and his heart went pit-a-pat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why d&rsquo;you want to kiss me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He knew he ought to reply: &ldquo;Because I love you.&rdquo; But he could not
bring himself to say it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why do you think?&rdquo; he asked instead.
</p>

<p>
She looked at him with smiling eyes and touched his face with the tips of her
fingers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How smooth your face is,&rdquo; she murmured.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want shaving awfully,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
It was astonishing how difficult he found it to make romantic speeches. He
found that silence helped him much more than words. He could look inexpressible
things. Miss Wilkinson sighed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you like me at all?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, awfully.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When he tried to kiss her again she did not resist. He pretended to be much
more passionate than he really was, and he succeeded in playing a part which
looked very well in his own eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to be rather frightened of you,&rdquo; said Miss
Wilkinson.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come out after supper, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he begged.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not unless you promise to behave yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was catching fire from the flame he was partly simulating, and at tea-time
he was obstreperously merry. Miss Wilkinson looked at him nervously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t have those shining eyes,&rdquo; she said to him
afterwards. &ldquo;What will your Aunt Louisa think?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what she thinks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Wilkinson gave a little laugh of pleasure. They had no sooner finished
supper than he said to her:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you going to keep me company while I smoke a cigarette?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you let Miss Wilkinson rest?&rdquo; said Mrs. Carey.
&ldquo;You must remember she&rsquo;s not as young as you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d like to go out, Mrs. Carey,&rdquo; she said, rather
acidly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;After dinner walk a mile, after supper rest a while,&rdquo; said the
Vicar.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your aunt is very nice, but she gets on my nerves sometimes,&rdquo; said
Miss Wilkinson, as soon as they closed the side-door behind them.
</p>

<p>
Philip threw away the cigarette he had just lighted, and flung his arms round
her. She tried to push him away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You promised you&rsquo;d be good, Philip.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think I was going to keep a promise like that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not so near the house, Philip,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Supposing someone
should come out suddenly?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He led her to the kitchen garden where no one was likely to come, and this time
Miss Wilkinson did not think of earwigs. He kissed her passionately. It was one
of the things that puzzled him that he did not like her at all in the morning,
and only moderately in the afternoon, but at night the touch of her hand
thrilled him. He said things that he would never have thought himself capable
of saying; he could certainly never have said them in the broad light of day;
and he listened to himself with wonder and satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How beautifully you make love,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
That was what he thought himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, if I could only say all the things that burn my heart!&rdquo; he
murmured passionately.
</p>

<p>
It was splendid. It was the most thrilling game he had ever played; and the
wonderful thing was that he felt almost all he said. It was only that he
exaggerated a little. He was tremendously interested and excited in the effect
he could see it had on her. It was obviously with an effort that at last she
suggested going in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t go yet,&rdquo; he cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m frightened.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had a sudden intuition what was the right thing to do then.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go in yet. I shall stay here and think. My cheeks are
burning. I want the night-air. Good-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He held out his hand seriously, and she took it in silence. He thought she
stifled a sob. Oh, it was magnificent! When, after a decent interval during
which he had been rather bored in the dark garden by himself, he went in he
found that Miss Wilkinson had already gone to bed.
</p>

<p>
After that things were different between them. The next day and the day after
Philip showed himself an eager lover. He was deliciously flattered to discover
that Miss Wilkinson was in love with him: she told him so in English, and she
told him so in French. She paid him compliments. No one had ever informed him
before that his eyes were charming and that he had a sensual mouth. He had
never bothered much about his personal appearance, but now, when occasion
presented, he looked at himself in the glass with satisfaction. When he kissed
her it was wonderful to feel the passion that seemed to thrill her soul. He
kissed her a good deal, for he found it easier to do that than to say the
things he instinctively felt she expected of him. It still made him feel a fool
to say he worshipped her. He wished there were someone to whom he could boast a
little, and he would willingly have discussed minute points of his conduct.
Sometimes she said things that were enigmatic, and he was puzzled. He wished
Hayward had been there so that he could ask him what he thought she meant, and
what he had better do next. He could not make up his mind whether he ought to
rush things or let them take their time. There were only three weeks more.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to think of that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It breaks
my heart. And then perhaps we shall never see one another again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you cared for me at all, you wouldn&rsquo;t be so unkind to
me,&rdquo; he whispered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, why can&rsquo;t you be content to let it go on as it is? Men are
always the same. They&rsquo;re never satisfied.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And when he pressed her, she said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you see it&rsquo;s impossible. How can we here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He proposed all sorts of schemes, but she would not have anything to do with
them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t take the risk. It would be too dreadful if your aunt
found out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A day or two later he had an idea which seemed brilliant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here, if you had a headache on Sunday evening and offered to stay
at home and look after the house, Aunt Louisa would go to church.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Generally Mrs. Carey remained in on Sunday evening in order to allow Mary Ann
to go to church, but she would welcome the opportunity of attending evensong.
</p>

<p>
Philip had not found it necessary to impart to his relations the change in his
views on Christianity which had occurred in Germany; they could not be expected
to understand; and it seemed less trouble to go to church quietly. But he only
went in the morning. He regarded this as a graceful concession to the
prejudices of society and his refusal to go a second time as an adequate
assertion of free thought.
</p>

<p>
When he made the suggestion, Miss Wilkinson did not speak for a moment, then
shook her head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
But on Sunday at tea-time she surprised Philip. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
I&rsquo;ll come to church this evening,&rdquo; she said suddenly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve really got a dreadful headache.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Carey, much concerned, insisted on giving her some &lsquo;drops&rsquo;
which she was herself in the habit of using. Miss Wilkinson thanked her, and
immediately after tea announced that she would go to her room and lie down.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you sure there&rsquo;s nothing you&rsquo;ll want?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Carey anxiously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite sure, thank you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because, if there isn&rsquo;t, I think I&rsquo;ll go to church. I
don&rsquo;t often have the chance of going in the evening.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, do go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall be in,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;If Miss Wilkinson wants
anything, she can always call me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better leave the drawing-room door open, Philip, so that if
Miss Wilkinson rings, you&rsquo;ll hear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
So after six o&rsquo;clock Philip was left alone in the house with Miss
Wilkinson. He felt sick with apprehension. He wished with all his heart that he
had not suggested the plan; but it was too late now; he must take the
opportunity which he had made. What would Miss Wilkinson think of him if he did
not! He went into the hall and listened. There was not a sound. He wondered if
Miss Wilkinson really had a headache. Perhaps she had forgotten his suggestion.
His heart beat painfully. He crept up the stairs as softly as he could, and he
stopped with a start when they creaked. He stood outside Miss Wilkinson&rsquo;s
room and listened; he put his hand on the knob of the door-handle. He waited.
It seemed to him that he waited for at least five minutes, trying to make up
his mind; and his hand trembled. He would willingly have bolted, but he was
afraid of the remorse which he knew would seize him. It was like getting on the
highest diving-board in a swimming-bath; it looked nothing from below, but when
you got up there and stared down at the water your heart sank; and the only
thing that forced you to dive was the shame of coming down meekly by the steps
you had climbed up. Philip screwed up his courage. He turned the handle softly
and walked in. He seemed to himself to be trembling like a leaf.
</p>

<p>
Miss Wilkinson was standing at the dressing-table with her back to the door,
and she turned round quickly when she heard it open.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you. What d&rsquo;you want?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She had taken off her skirt and blouse, and was standing in her petticoat. It
was short and only came down to the top of her boots; the upper part of it was
black, of some shiny material, and there was a red flounce. She wore a camisole
of white calico with short arms. She looked grotesque. Philip&rsquo;s heart
sank as he stared at her; she had never seemed so unattractive; but it was too
late now. He closed the door behind him and locked it.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>XXXV</h2>

<p>
Philip woke early next morning. His sleep had been restless; but when he
stretched his legs and looked at the sunshine that slid through the Venetian
blinds, making patterns on the floor, he sighed with satisfaction. He was
delighted with himself. He began to think of Miss Wilkinson. She had asked him
to call her Emily, but, he knew not why, he could not; he always thought of her
as Miss Wilkinson. Since she chid him for so addressing her, he avoided using
her name at all. During his childhood he had often heard a sister of Aunt
Louisa, the widow of a naval officer, spoken of as Aunt Emily. It made him
uncomfortable to call Miss Wilkinson by that name, nor could he think of any
that would have suited her better. She had begun as Miss Wilkinson, and it
seemed inseparable from his impression of her. He frowned a little: somehow or
other he saw her now at her worst; he could not forget his dismay when she
turned round and he saw her in her camisole and the short petticoat; he
remembered the slight roughness of her skin and the sharp, long lines on the
side of the neck. His triumph was short-lived. He reckoned out her age again,
and he did not see how she could be less than forty. It made the affair
ridiculous. She was plain and old. His quick fancy showed her to him, wrinkled,
haggard, made-up, in those frocks which were too showy for her position and too
young for her years. He shuddered; he felt suddenly that he never wanted to see
her again; he could not bear the thought of kissing her. He was horrified with
himself. Was that love?
</p>

<p>
He took as long as he could over dressing in order to put back the moment of
seeing her, and when at last he went into the dining-room it was with a sinking
heart. Prayers were over, and they were sitting down at breakfast.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lazybones,&rdquo; Miss Wilkinson cried gaily.
</p>

<p>
He looked at her and gave a little gasp of relief. She was sitting with her
back to the window. She was really quite nice. He wondered why he had thought
such things about her. His self-satisfaction returned to him.
</p>

<p>
He was taken aback by the change in her. She told him in a voice thrilling with
emotion immediately after breakfast that she loved him; and when a little later
they went into the drawing-room for his singing lesson and she sat down on the
music-stool she put up her face in the middle of a scale and said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Embrasse-moi.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When he bent down she flung her arms round his neck. It was slightly
uncomfortable, for she held him in such a position that he felt rather choked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, je t&rsquo;aime. Je t&rsquo;aime. Je t&rsquo;aime,&rdquo; she cried,
with her extravagantly French accent.
</p>

<p>
Philip wished she would speak English.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s struck you that the
gardener&rsquo;s quite likely to pass the window any minute.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, je m&rsquo;en fiche du jardinier. Je m&rsquo;en refiche, et je
m&rsquo;en contrefiche.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip thought it was very like a French novel, and he did not know why it
slightly irritated him.
</p>

<p>
At last he said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I think I&rsquo;ll tootle along to the beach and have a
dip.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re not going to leave me this morning&mdash;of all
mornings?&rdquo; Philip did not quite know why he should not, but it did not
matter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would you like me to stay?&rdquo; he smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you darling! But no, go. Go. I want to think of you mastering the
salt sea waves, bathing your limbs in the broad ocean.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He got his hat and sauntered off.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What rot women talk!&rdquo; he thought to himself.
</p>

<p>
But he was pleased and happy and flattered. She was evidently frightfully gone
on him. As he limped along the high street of Blackstable he looked with a
tinge of superciliousness at the people he passed. He knew a good many to nod
to, and as he gave them a smile of recognition he thought to himself, if they
only knew! He did want someone to know very badly. He thought he would write to
Hayward, and in his mind composed the letter. He would talk of the garden and
the roses, and the little French governess, like an exotic flower amongst them,
scented and perverse: he would say she was French, because&mdash;well, she had
lived in France so long that she almost was, and besides it would be shabby to
give the whole thing away too exactly, don&rsquo;t you know; and he would tell
Hayward how he had seen her first in her pretty muslin dress and of the flower
she had given him. He made a delicate idyl of it: the sunshine and the sea gave
it passion and magic, and the stars added poetry, and the old vicarage garden
was a fit and exquisite setting. There was something Meredithian about it: it
was not quite Lucy Feverel and not quite Clara Middleton; but it was
inexpressibly charming. Philip&rsquo;s heart beat quickly. He was so delighted
with his fancies that he began thinking of them again as soon as he crawled
back, dripping and cold, into his bathing-machine. He thought of the object of
his affections. She had the most adorable little nose and large brown
eyes&mdash;he would describe her to Hayward&mdash;and masses of soft brown
hair, the sort of hair it was delicious to bury your face in, and a skin which
was like ivory and sunshine, and her cheek was like a red, red rose. How old
was she? Eighteen perhaps, and he called her Musette. Her laughter was like a
rippling brook, and her voice was so soft, so low, it was the sweetest music he
had ever heard.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What ARE you thinking about?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip stopped suddenly. He was walking slowly home.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waving at you for the last quarter of a mile. You ARE
absent-minded.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Wilkinson was standing in front of him, laughing at his surprise.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d come and meet you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s awfully nice of you,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did I startle you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You did a bit,&rdquo; he admitted.
</p>

<p>
He wrote his letter to Hayward all the same. There were eight pages of it.
</p>

<p>
The fortnight that remained passed quickly, and though each evening, when they
went into the garden after supper, Miss Wilkinson remarked that one day more
had gone, Philip was in too cheerful spirits to let the thought depress him.
One night Miss Wilkinson suggested that it would be delightful if she could
exchange her situation in Berlin for one in London. Then they could see one
another constantly. Philip said it would be very jolly, but the prospect
aroused no enthusiasm in him; he was looking forward to a wonderful life in
London, and he preferred not to be hampered. He spoke a little too freely of
all he meant to do, and allowed Miss Wilkinson to see that already he was
longing to be off.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t talk like that if you loved me,&rdquo; she cried.
</p>

<p>
He was taken aback and remained silent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a fool I&rsquo;ve been,&rdquo; she muttered.
</p>

<p>
To his surprise he saw that she was crying. He had a tender heart, and hated to
see anyone miserable.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m awfully sorry. What have I done? Don&rsquo;t cry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Philip, don&rsquo;t leave me. You don&rsquo;t know what you mean to
me. I have such a wretched life, and you&rsquo;ve made me so happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He kissed her silently. There really was anguish in her tone, and he was
frightened. It had never occurred to him that she meant what she said quite,
quite seriously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry. You know I&rsquo;m frightfully fond of you. I
wish you would come to London.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know I can&rsquo;t. Places are almost impossible to get, and I hate
English life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Almost unconscious that he was acting a part, moved by her distress, he pressed
her more and more. Her tears vaguely flattered him, and he kissed her with real
passion.
</p>

<p>
But a day or two later she made a real scene. There was a tennis-party at the
vicarage, and two girls came, daughters of a retired major in an Indian
regiment who had lately settled in Blackstable. They were very pretty, one was
Philip&rsquo;s age and the other was a year or two younger. Being used to the
society of young men (they were full of stories of hill-stations in India, and
at that time the stories of Rudyard Kipling were in every hand) they began to
chaff Philip gaily; and he, pleased with the novelty&mdash;the young ladies at
Blackstable treated the Vicar&rsquo;s nephew with a certain
seriousness&mdash;was gay and jolly. Some devil within him prompted him to
start a violent flirtation with them both, and as he was the only young man
there, they were quite willing to meet him half-way. It happened that they
played tennis quite well and Philip was tired of pat-ball with Miss Wilkinson
(she had only begun to play when she came to Blackstable), so when he arranged
the sets after tea he suggested that Miss Wilkinson should play against the
curate&rsquo;s wife, with the curate as her partner; and he would play later
with the new-comers. He sat down by the elder Miss O&rsquo;Connor and said to
her in an undertone:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get the duffers out of the way first, and then we&rsquo;ll
have a jolly set afterwards.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Apparently Miss Wilkinson overheard him, for she threw down her racket, and,
saying she had a headache, went away. It was plain to everyone that she was
offended. Philip was annoyed that she should make the fact public. The set was
arranged without her, but presently Mrs. Carey called him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Philip, you&rsquo;ve hurt Emily&rsquo;s feelings. She&rsquo;s gone to
her room and she&rsquo;s crying.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What about?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, something about a duffer&rsquo;s set. Do go to her, and say you
didn&rsquo;t mean to be unkind, there&rsquo;s a good boy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He knocked at Miss Wilkinson&rsquo;s door, but receiving no answer went in. He
found her lying face downwards on her bed, weeping. He touched her on the
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, what on earth&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Leave me alone. I never want to speak to you again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What have I done? I&rsquo;m awfully sorry if I&rsquo;ve hurt your
feelings. I didn&rsquo;t mean to. I say, do get up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so unhappy. How could you be cruel to me? You know I hate
that stupid game. I only play because I want to play with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She got up and walked towards the dressing-table, but after a quick look in the
glass sank into a chair. She made her handkerchief into a ball and dabbed her
eyes with it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given you the greatest thing a woman can give a man&mdash;oh,
what a fool I was&mdash;and you have no gratitude. You must be quite heartless.
How could you be so cruel as to torment me by flirting with those vulgar girls.
We&rsquo;ve only got just over a week. Can&rsquo;t you even give me
that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip stood over her rather sulkily. He thought her behaviour childish. He was
vexed with her for having shown her ill-temper before strangers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you know I don&rsquo;t care twopence about either of the
O&rsquo;Connors. Why on earth should you think I do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Wilkinson put away her handkerchief. Her tears had made marks on her
powdered face, and her hair was somewhat disarranged. Her white dress did not
suit her very well just then. She looked at Philip with hungry, passionate
eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re twenty and so&rsquo;s she,&rdquo; she said
hoarsely. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m old.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip reddened and looked away. The anguish of her tone made him feel
strangely uneasy. He wished with all his heart that he had never had anything
to do with Miss Wilkinson.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to make you unhappy,&rdquo; he said awkwardly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go down and look after your friends. They&rsquo;ll
wonder what has become of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was glad to leave her.
</p>

<p>
The quarrel was quickly followed by a reconciliation, but the few days that
remained were sometimes irksome to Philip. He wanted to talk of nothing but the
future, and the future invariably reduced Miss Wilkinson to tears. At first her
weeping affected him, and feeling himself a beast he redoubled his
protestations of undying passion; but now it irritated him: it would have been
all very well if she had been a girl, but it was silly of a grown-up woman to
cry so much. She never ceased reminding him that he was under a debt of
gratitude to her which he could never repay. He was willing to acknowledge this
since she made a point of it, but he did not really know why he should be any
more grateful to her than she to him. He was expected to show his sense of
obligation in ways which were rather a nuisance: he had been a good deal used
to solitude, and it was a necessity to him sometimes; but Miss Wilkinson looked
upon it as an unkindness if he was not always at her beck and call. The Miss
O&rsquo;Connors asked them both to tea, and Philip would have liked to go, but
Miss Wilkinson said she only had five days more and wanted him entirely to
herself. It was flattering, but a bore. Miss Wilkinson told him stories of the
exquisite delicacy of Frenchmen when they stood in the same relation to fair
ladies as he to Miss Wilkinson. She praised their courtesy, their passion for
self-sacrifice, their perfect tact. Miss Wilkinson seemed to want a great deal.
</p>

<p>
Philip listened to her enumeration of the qualities which must be possessed by
the perfect lover, and he could not help feeling a certain satisfaction that
she lived in Berlin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will write to me, won&rsquo;t you? Write to me every day. I want to
know everything you&rsquo;re doing. You must keep nothing from me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall be awfully, busy&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write as
often as I can.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She flung her arms passionately round his neck. He was embarrassed sometimes by
the demonstrations of her affection. He would have preferred her to be more
passive. It shocked him a little that she should give him so marked a lead: it
did not tally altogether with his prepossessions about the modesty of the
feminine temperament.
</p>

<p>
At length the day came on which Miss Wilkinson was to go, and she came down to
breakfast, pale and subdued, in a serviceable travelling dress of black and
white check. She looked a very competent governess. Philip was silent too, for
he did not quite know what to say that would fit the circumstance; and he was
terribly afraid that, if he said something flippant, Miss Wilkinson would break
down before his uncle and make a scene. They had said their last good-bye to
one another in the garden the night before, and Philip was relieved that there
was now no opportunity for them to be alone. He remained in the dining-room
after breakfast in case Miss Wilkinson should insist on kissing him on the
stairs. He did not want Mary Ann, now a woman hard upon middle age with a sharp
tongue, to catch them in a compromising position. Mary Ann did not like Miss
Wilkinson and called her an old cat. Aunt Louisa was not very well and could
not come to the station, but the Vicar and Philip saw her off. Just as the
train was leaving she leaned out and kissed Mr. Carey.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must kiss you too, Philip,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, blushing.
</p>

<p>
He stood up on the step and she kissed him quickly. The train started, and Miss
Wilkinson sank into the corner of her carriage and wept disconsolately. Philip,
as he walked back to the vicarage, felt a distinct sensation of relief.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, did you see her safely off?&rdquo; asked Aunt Louisa, when they
got in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, she seemed rather weepy. She insisted on kissing me and
Philip.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, well, at her age it&rsquo;s not dangerous.&rdquo; Mrs. Carey pointed
to the sideboard. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a letter for you, Philip. It came by the
second post.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was from Hayward and ran as follows:
</p>

<p>
My dear boy,
</p>

<p>
I answer your letter at once. I ventured to read it to a great friend of mine,
a charming woman whose help and sympathy have been very precious to me, a woman
withal with a real feeling for art and literature; and we agreed that it was
charming. You wrote from your heart and you do not know the delightful naivete
which is in every line. And because you love you write like a poet. Ah, dear
boy, that is the real thing: I felt the glow of your young passion, and your
prose was musical from the sincerity of your emotion. You must be happy! I wish
I could have been present unseen in that enchanted garden while you wandered
hand in hand, like Daphnis and Chloe, amid the flowers. I can see you, my
Daphnis, with the light of young love in your eyes, tender, enraptured, and
ardent; while Chloe in your arms, so young and soft and fresh, vowing she would
ne&rsquo;er consent&mdash;consented. Roses and violets and honeysuckle! Oh, my
friend, I envy you. It is so good to think that your first love should have
been pure poetry. Treasure the moments, for the immortal gods have given you
the Greatest Gift of All, and it will be a sweet, sad memory till your dying
day. You will never again enjoy that careless rapture. First love is best love;
and she is beautiful and you are young, and all the world is yours. I felt my
pulse go faster when with your adorable simplicity you told me that you buried
your face in her long hair. I am sure that it is that exquisite chestnut which
seems just touched with gold. I would have you sit under a leafy tree side by
side, and read together Romeo and Juliet; and then I would have you fall on
your knees and on my behalf kiss the ground on which her foot has left its
imprint; then tell her it is the homage of a poet to her radiant youth and to
your love for her.<br/>
Yours always,<br/>
G. Etheridge Hayward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What damned rot!&rdquo; said Philip, when he finished the letter.
</p>

<p>
Miss Wilkinson oddly enough had suggested that they should read Romeo and
Juliet together; but Philip had firmly declined. Then, as he put the letter in
his pocket, he felt a queer little pang of bitterness because reality seemed so
different from the ideal.

<h2>XXXVI</h2>

<p>
A few days later Philip went to London. The curate had recommended rooms in
Barnes, and these Philip engaged by letter at fourteen shillings a week. He
reached them in the evening; and the landlady, a funny little old woman with a
shrivelled body and a deeply wrinkled face, had prepared high tea for him. Most
of the sitting-room was taken up by the sideboard and a square table; against
one wall was a sofa covered with horsehair, and by the fireplace an arm-chair
to match: there was a white antimacassar over the back of it, and on the seat,
because the springs were broken, a hard cushion.
</p>

<p>
After having his tea he unpacked and arranged his books, then he sat down and
tried to read; but he was depressed. The silence in the street made him
slightly uncomfortable, and he felt very much alone.
</p>

<p>
Next day he got up early. He put on his tail-coat and the tall hat which he had
worn at school; but it was very shabby, and he made up his mind to stop at the
Stores on his way to the office and buy a new one. When he had done this he
found himself in plenty of time and so walked along the Strand. The office of
Messrs. Herbert Carter &amp; Co. was in a little street off Chancery Lane, and
he had to ask his way two or three times. He felt that people were staring at
him a great deal, and once he took off his hat to see whether by chance the
label had been left on. When he arrived he knocked at the door; but no one
answered, and looking at his watch he found it was barely half past nine; he
supposed he was too early. He went away and ten minutes later returned to find
an office-boy, with a long nose, pimply face, and a Scotch accent, opening the
door. Philip asked for Mr. Herbert Carter. He had not come yet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When will he be here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Between ten and half past.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d better wait,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you wanting?&rdquo; asked the office-boy.
</p>

<p>
Philip was nervous, but tried to hide the fact by a jocose manner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to work here if you have no objection.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re the new articled clerk? You&rsquo;d better come in. Mr.
Goodworthy&rsquo;ll be here in a while.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip walked in, and as he did so saw the office-boy&mdash;he was about the
same age as Philip and called himself a junior clerk&mdash;look at his foot. He
flushed and, sitting down, hid it behind the other. He looked round the room.
It was dark and very dingy. It was lit by a skylight. There were three rows of
desks in it and against them high stools. Over the chimney-piece was a dirty
engraving of a prize-fight. Presently a clerk came in and then another; they
glanced at Philip and in an undertone asked the office-boy (Philip found his
name was Macdougal) who he was. A whistle blew, and Macdougal got up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Goodworthy&rsquo;s come. He&rsquo;s the managing clerk. Shall I tell
him you&rsquo;re here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, please,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
The office-boy went out and in a moment returned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you come this way?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip followed him across the passage and was shown into a room, small and
barely furnished, in which a little, thin man was standing with his back to the
fireplace. He was much below the middle height, but his large head, which
seemed to hang loosely on his body, gave him an odd ungainliness. His features
were wide and flattened, and he had prominent, pale eyes; his thin hair was
sandy; he wore whiskers that grew unevenly on his face, and in places where you
would have expected the hair to grow thickly there was no hair at all. His skin
was pasty and yellow. He held out his hand to Philip, and when he smiled showed
badly decayed teeth. He spoke with a patronising and at the same time a timid
air, as though he sought to assume an importance which he did not feel. He said
he hoped Philip would like the work; there was a good deal of drudgery about
it, but when you got used to it, it was interesting; and one made money, that
was the chief thing, wasn&rsquo;t it? He laughed with his odd mixture of
superiority and shyness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Carter will be here presently,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a
little late on Monday mornings sometimes. I&rsquo;ll call you when he comes. In
the meantime I must give you something to do. Do you know anything about
book-keeping or accounts?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; answered Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suppose you would. They don&rsquo;t teach you things at
school that are much use in business, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo; He considered
for a moment. &ldquo;I think I can find you something to do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He went into the next room and after a little while came out with a large
cardboard box. It contained a vast number of letters in great disorder, and he
told Philip to sort them out and arrange them alphabetically according to the
names of the writers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you to the room in which the articled clerk generally
sits. There&rsquo;s a very nice fellow in it. His name is Watson. He&rsquo;s a
son of Watson, Crag, and Thompson&mdash;you know&mdash;the brewers. He&rsquo;s
spending a year with us to learn business.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Goodworthy led Philip through the dingy office, where now six or eight
clerks were working, into a narrow room behind. It had been made into a
separate apartment by a glass partition, and here they found Watson sitting
back in a chair, reading The Sportsman. He was a large, stout young man,
elegantly dressed, and he looked up as Mr. Goodworthy entered. He asserted his
position by calling the managing clerk Goodworthy. The managing clerk objected
to the familiarity, and pointedly called him Mr. Watson, but Watson, instead of
seeing that it was a rebuke, accepted the title as a tribute to his
gentlemanliness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see they&rsquo;ve scratched Rigoletto,&rdquo; he said to Philip, as
soon as they were left alone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have they?&rdquo; said Philip, who knew nothing about horse-racing.
</p>

<p>
He looked with awe upon Watson&rsquo;s beautiful clothes. His tail-coat fitted
him perfectly, and there was a valuable pin artfully stuck in the middle of an
enormous tie. On the chimney-piece rested his tall hat; it was saucy and
bell-shaped and shiny. Philip felt himself very shabby. Watson began to talk of
hunting&mdash;it was such an infernal bore having to waste one&rsquo;s time in
an infernal office, he would only be able to hunt on Saturdays&mdash;and
shooting: he had ripping invitations all over the country and of course he had
to refuse them. It was infernal luck, but he wasn&rsquo;t going to put up with
it long; he was only in this internal hole for a year, and then he was going
into the business, and he would hunt four days a week and get all the shooting
there was.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got five years of it, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he said,
waving his arm round the tiny room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I daresay I shall see something of you. Carter does our accounts, you
know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was somewhat overpowered by the young gentleman&rsquo;s condescension.
At Blackstable they had always looked upon brewing with civil contempt, the
Vicar made little jokes about the beerage, and it was a surprising experience
for Philip to discover that Watson was such an important and magnificent
fellow. He had been to Winchester and to Oxford, and his conversation impressed
the fact upon one with frequency. When he discovered the details of
Philip&rsquo;s education his manner became more patronising still.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course, if one doesn&rsquo;t go to a public school those sort of
schools are the next best thing, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip asked about the other men in the office.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t bother about them much, you know,&rdquo; said Watson.
&ldquo;Carter&rsquo;s not a bad sort. We have him to dine now and then. All the
rest are awful bounders.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Presently Watson applied himself to some work he had in hand, and Philip set
about sorting his letters. Then Mr. Goodworthy came in to say that Mr. Carter
had arrived. He took Philip into a large room next door to his own. There was a
big desk in it, and a couple of big arm-chairs; a Turkey carpet adorned the
floor, and the walls were decorated with sporting prints. Mr. Carter was
sitting at the desk and got up to shake hands with Philip. He was dressed in a
long frock coat. He looked like a military man; his moustache was waxed, his
gray hair was short and neat, he held himself upright, he talked in a breezy
way, he lived at Enfield. He was very keen on games and the good of the
country. He was an officer in the Hertfordshire Yeomanry and chairman of the
Conservative Association. When he was told that a local magnate had said no one
would take him for a City man, he felt that he had not lived in vain. He talked
to Philip in a pleasant, off-hand fashion. Mr. Goodworthy would look after him.
Watson was a nice fellow, perfect gentleman, good sportsman&mdash;did Philip
hunt? Pity, THE sport for gentlemen. Didn&rsquo;t have much chance of hunting
now, had to leave that to his son. His son was at Cambridge, he&rsquo;d sent
him to Rugby, fine school Rugby, nice class of boys there, in a couple of years
his son would be articled, that would be nice for Philip, he&rsquo;d like his
son, thorough sportsman. He hoped Philip would get on well and like the work,
he mustn&rsquo;t miss his lectures, they were getting up the tone of the
profession, they wanted gentlemen in it. Well, well, Mr. Goodworthy was there.
If he wanted to know anything Mr. Goodworthy would tell him. What was his
handwriting like? Ah well, Mr. Goodworthy would see about that.
</p>

<p>
Philip was overwhelmed by so much gentlemanliness: in East Anglia they knew who
were gentlemen and who weren&rsquo;t, but the gentlemen didn&rsquo;t talk about
it.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">

<h2>XXXVII</h2>

<p>
At first the novelty of the work kept Philip interested. Mr. Carter dictated
letters to him, and he had to make fair copies of statements of accounts.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Carter preferred to conduct the office on gentlemanly lines; he would have
nothing to do with typewriting and looked upon shorthand with disfavour: the
office-boy knew shorthand, but it was only Mr. Goodworthy who made use of his
accomplishment. Now and then Philip with one of the more experienced clerks
went out to audit the accounts of some firm: he came to know which of the
clients must be treated with respect and which were in low water. Now and then
long lists of figures were given him to add up. He attended lectures for his
first examination. Mr. Goodworthy repeated to him that the work was dull at
first, but he would grow used to it. Philip left the office at six and walked
across the river to Waterloo. His supper was waiting for him when he reached
his lodgings and he spent the evening reading. On Saturday afternoons he went
to the National Gallery. Hayward had recommended to him a guide which had been
compiled out of Ruskin&rsquo;s works, and with this in hand he went
industriously through room after room: he read carefully what the critic had
said about a picture and then in a determined fashion set himself to see the
same things in it. His Sundays were difficult to get through. He knew no one in
London and spent them by himself. Mr. Nixon, the solicitor, asked him to spend
a Sunday at Hampstead, and Philip passed a happy day with a set of exuberant
strangers; he ate and drank a great deal, took a walk on the heath, and came
away with a general invitation to come again whenever he liked; but he was
morbidly afraid of being in the way, so waited for a formal invitation.
Naturally enough it never came, for with numbers of friends of their own the
Nixons did not think of the lonely, silent boy whose claim upon their
hospitality was so small. So on Sundays he got up late and took a walk along
the tow-path. At Barnes the river is muddy, dingy, and tidal; it has neither
the graceful charm of the Thames above the locks nor the romance of the crowded
stream below London Bridge. In the afternoon he walked about the common; and
that is gray and dingy too; it is neither country nor town; the gorse is
stunted; and all about is the litter of civilisation. He went to a play every
Saturday night and stood cheerfully for an hour or more at the gallery-door. It
was not worth while to go back to Barnes for the interval between the closing
of the Museum and his meal in an A. B. C. shop, and the time hung heavily on
his hands. He strolled up Bond Street or through the Burlington Arcade, and
when he was tired went and sat down in the Park or in wet weather in the public
library in St. Martin&rsquo;s Lane. He looked at the people walking about and
envied them because they had friends; sometimes his envy turned to hatred
because they were happy and he was miserable. He had never imagined that it was
possible to be so lonely in a great city. Sometimes when he was standing at the
gallery-door the man next to him would attempt a conversation; but Philip had
the country boy&rsquo;s suspicion of strangers and answered in such a way as to
prevent any further acquaintance. After the play was over, obliged to keep to
himself all he thought about it, he hurried across the bridge to Waterloo. When
he got back to his rooms, in which for economy no fire had been lit, his heart
sank. It was horribly cheerless. He began to loathe his lodgings and the long
solitary evenings he spent in them. Sometimes he felt so lonely that he could
not read, and then he sat looking into the fire hour after hour in bitter
wretchedness.
</p>

<p>
He had spent three months in London now, and except for that one Sunday at
Hampstead had never talked to anyone but his fellow-clerks. One evening Watson
asked him to dinner at a restaurant and they went to a music-hall together; but
he felt shy and uncomfortable. Watson talked all the time of things he did not
care about, and while he looked upon Watson as a Philistine he could not help
admiring him. He was angry because Watson obviously set no store on his
culture, and with his way of taking himself at the estimate at which he saw
others held him he began to despise the acquirements which till then had seemed
to him not unimportant. He felt for the first time the humiliation of poverty.
His uncle sent him fourteen pounds a month and he had had to buy a good many
clothes. His evening suit cost him five guineas. He had not dared tell Watson
that it was bought in the Strand. Watson said there was only one tailor in
London.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you don&rsquo;t dance,&rdquo; said Watson, one day, with a
glance at Philip&rsquo;s club-foot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pity. I&rsquo;ve been asked to bring some dancing men to a ball. I could
have introduced you to some jolly girls.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Once or twice, hating the thought of going back to Barnes, Philip had remained
in town, and late in the evening wandered through the West End till he found
some house at which there was a party. He stood among the little group of
shabby people, behind the footmen, watching the guests arrive, and he listened
to the music that floated through the window. Sometimes, notwithstanding the
cold, a couple came on to the balcony and stood for a moment to get some fresh
air; and Philip, imagining that they were in love with one another, turned away
and limped along the street with a heavy hurt. He would never be able to stand
in that man&rsquo;s place. He felt that no woman could ever really look upon
him without distaste for his deformity.
</p>

<p>
That reminded him of Miss Wilkinson. He thought of her without satisfaction.
Before parting they had made an arrangement that she should write to Charing
Cross Post Office till he was able to send her an address, and when he went
there he found three letters from her. She wrote on blue paper with violet ink,
and she wrote in French. Philip wondered why she could not write in English
like a sensible woman, and her passionate expressions, because they reminded
him of a French novel, left him cold. She upbraided him for not having written,
and when he answered he excused himself by saying that he had been busy. He did
not quite know how to start the letter. He could not bring himself to use
dearest or darling, and he hated to address her as Emily, so finally he began
with the word dear. It looked odd, standing by itself, and rather silly, but he
made it do. It was the first love letter he had ever written, and he was
conscious of its tameness; he felt that he should say all sorts of vehement
things, how he thought of her every minute of the day and how he longed to kiss
her beautiful hands and how he trembled at the thought of her red lips, but
some inexplicable modesty prevented him; and instead he told her of his new
rooms and his office. The answer came by return of post, angry, heart-broken,
reproachful: how could he be so cold? Did he not know that she hung on his
letters? She had given him all that a woman could give, and this was her
reward. Was he tired of her already? Then, because he did not reply for several
days, Miss Wilkinson bombarded him with letters. She could not bear his
unkindness, she waited for the post, and it never brought her his letter, she
cried herself to sleep night after night, she was looking so ill that everyone
remarked on it: if he did not love her why did he not say so? She added that
she could not live without him, and the only thing was for her to commit
suicide. She told him he was cold and selfish and ungrateful. It was all in
French, and Philip knew that she wrote in that language to show off, but he was
worried all the same. He did not want to make her unhappy. In a little while
she wrote that she could not bear the separation any longer, she would arrange
to come over to London for Christmas. Philip wrote back that he would like
nothing better, only he had already an engagement to spend Christmas with
friends in the country, and he did not see how he could break it. She answered
that she did not wish to force herself on him, it was quite evident that he did
not wish to see her; she was deeply hurt, and she never thought he would repay
with such cruelty all her kindness. Her letter was touching, and Philip thought
he saw marks of her tears on the paper; he wrote an impulsive reply saying that
he was dreadfully sorry and imploring her to come; but it was with relief that
he received her answer in which she said that she found it would be impossible
for her to get away. Presently when her letters came his heart sank: he delayed
opening them, for he knew what they would contain, angry reproaches and
pathetic appeals; they would make him feel a perfect beast, and yet he did not
see with what he had to blame himself. He put off his answer from day to day,
and then another letter would come, saying she was ill and lonely and
miserable.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish to God I&rsquo;d never had anything to do with her,&rdquo; he
said.
</p>

<p>
He admired Watson because he arranged these things so easily. The young man had
been engaged in an intrigue with a girl who played in touring companies, and
his account of the affair filled Philip with envious amazement. But after a
time Watson&rsquo;s young affections changed, and one day he described the
rupture to Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought it was no good making any bones about it so I just told her
I&rsquo;d had enough of her,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t she make an awful scene?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The usual thing, you know, but I told her it was no good trying on that
sort of thing with me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did she cry?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She began to, but I can&rsquo;t stand women when they cry, so I said
she&rsquo;d better hook it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip&rsquo;s sense of humour was growing keener with advancing years.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And did she hook it?&rdquo; he asked smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, there wasn&rsquo;t anything else for her to do, was there?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the Christmas holidays approached. Mrs. Carey had been ill all
through November, and the doctor suggested that she and the Vicar should go to
Cornwall for a couple of weeks round Christmas so that she should get back her
strength. The result was that Philip had nowhere to go, and he spent Christmas
Day in his lodgings. Under Hayward&rsquo;s influence he had persuaded himself
that the festivities that attend this season were vulgar and barbaric, and he
made up his mind that he would take no notice of the day; but when it came, the
jollity of all around affected him strangely. His landlady and her husband were
spending the day with a married daughter, and to save trouble Philip announced
that he would take his meals out. He went up to London towards mid-day and ate
a slice of turkey and some Christmas pudding by himself at Gatti&rsquo;s, and
since he had nothing to do afterwards went to Westminster Abbey for the
afternoon service. The streets were almost empty, and the people who went along
had a preoccupied look; they did not saunter but walked with some definite goal
in view, and hardly anyone was alone. To Philip they all seemed happy. He felt
himself more solitary than he had ever done in his life. His intention had been
to kill the day somehow in the streets and then dine at a restaurant, but he
could not face again the sight of cheerful people, talking, laughing, and
making merry; so he went back to Waterloo, and on his way through the
Westminster Bridge Road bought some ham and a couple of mince pies and went
back to Barnes. He ate his food in his lonely little room and spent the evening
with a book. His depression was almost intolerable.
</p>

<p>
When he was back at the office it made him very sore to listen to
Watson&rsquo;s account of the short holiday. They had had some jolly girls
staying with them, and after dinner they had cleared out the drawing-room and
had a dance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get to bed till three and I don&rsquo;t know how I got
there then. By George, I was squiffy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At last Philip asked desperately:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How does one get to know people in London?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Watson looked at him with surprise and with a slightly contemptuous amusement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know, one just knows them. If you go to dances you
soon get to know as many people as you can do with.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip hated Watson, and yet he would have given anything to change places with
him. The old feeling that he had had at school came back to him, and he tried
to throw himself into the other&rsquo;s skin, imagining what life would be if
he were Watson.

<h2>XXXVIII</h2>

<p>
At the end of the year there was a great deal to do. Philip went to various
places with a clerk named Thompson and spent the day monotonously calling out
items of expenditure, which the other checked; and sometimes he was given long
pages of figures to add up. He had never had a head for figures, and he could
only do this slowly. Thompson grew irritated at his mistakes. His fellow-clerk
was a long, lean man of forty, sallow, with black hair and a ragged moustache;
he had hollow cheeks and deep lines on each side of his nose. He took a dislike
to Philip because he was an articled clerk. Because he could put down three
hundred guineas and keep himself for five years Philip had the chance of a
career; while he, with his experience and ability, had no possibility of ever
being more than a clerk at thirty-five shillings a week. He was a cross-grained
man, oppressed by a large family, and he resented the superciliousness which he
fancied he saw in Philip. He sneered at Philip because he was better educated
than himself, and he mocked at Philip&rsquo;s pronunciation; he could not
forgive him because he spoke without a cockney accent, and when he talked to
him sarcastically exaggerated his aitches. At first his manner was merely gruff
and repellent, but as he discovered that Philip had no gift for accountancy he
took pleasure in humiliating him; his attacks were gross and silly, but they
wounded Philip, and in self-defence he assumed an attitude of superiority which
he did not feel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Had a bath this morning?&rdquo; Thompson said when Philip came to the
office late, for his early punctuality had not lasted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not a gentleman, I&rsquo;m only a clerk. I have a bath on
Saturday night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re more than usually disagreeable
on Monday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you condescend to do a few sums in simple addition today? I&rsquo;m
afraid it&rsquo;s asking a great deal from a gentleman who knows Latin and
Greek.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your attempts at sarcasm are not very happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Philip could not conceal from himself that the other clerks, ill-paid and
uncouth, were more useful than himself. Once or twice Mr. Goodworthy grew
impatient with him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You really ought to be able to do better than this by now,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not even as smart as the office-boy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip listened sulkily. He did not like being blamed, and it humiliated him,
when, having been given accounts to make fair copies of, Mr. Goodworthy was not
satisfied and gave them to another clerk to do. At first the work had been
tolerable from its novelty, but now it grew irksome; and when he discovered
that he had no aptitude for it, he began to hate it. Often, when he should have
been doing something that was given him, he wasted his time drawing little
pictures on the office note-paper. He made sketches of Watson in every
conceivable attitude, and Watson was impressed by his talent. It occurred to
him to take the drawings home, and he came back next day with the praises of
his family.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder you didn&rsquo;t become a painter,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Only
of course there&rsquo;s no money in it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It chanced that Mr. Carter two or three days later was dining with the Watsons,
and the sketches were shown him. The following morning he sent for Philip.
Philip saw him seldom and stood in some awe of him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here, young fellow, I don&rsquo;t care what you do out of
office-hours, but I&rsquo;ve seen those sketches of yours and they&rsquo;re on
office-paper, and Mr. Goodworthy tells me you&rsquo;re slack. You won&rsquo;t
do any good as a chartered accountant unless you look alive. It&rsquo;s a fine
profession, and we&rsquo;re getting a very good class of men in it, but
it&rsquo;s a profession in which you have to…&rdquo; he looked for the
termination of his phrase, but could not find exactly what he wanted, so
finished rather tamely, &ldquo;in which you have to look alive.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Perhaps Philip would have settled down but for the agreement that if he did not
like the work he could leave after a year, and get back half the money paid for
his articles. He felt that he was fit for something better than to add up
accounts, and it was humiliating that he did so ill something which seemed
contemptible. The vulgar scenes with Thompson got on his nerves. In March
Watson ended his year at the office and Philip, though he did not care for him,
saw him go with regret. The fact that the other clerks disliked them equally,
because they belonged to a class a little higher than their own, was a bond of
union. When Philip thought that he must spend over four years more with that
dreary set of fellows his heart sank. He had expected wonderful things from
London and it had given him nothing. He hated it now. He did not know a soul,
and he had no idea how he was to get to know anyone. He was tired of going
everywhere by himself. He began to feel that he could not stand much more of
such a life. He would lie in bed at night and think of the joy of never seeing
again that dingy office or any of the men in it, and of getting away from those
drab lodgings.
</p>

<p>
A great disappointment befell him in the spring. Hayward had announced his
intention of coming to London for the season, and Philip had looked forward
very much to seeing him again. He had read so much lately and thought so much
that his mind was full of ideas which he wanted to discuss, and he knew nobody
who was willing to interest himself in abstract things. He was quite excited at
the thought of talking his fill with someone, and he was wretched when Hayward
wrote to say that the spring was lovelier than ever he had known it in Italy,
and he could not bear to tear himself away. He went on to ask why Philip did
not come. What was the use of squandering the days of his youth in an office
when the world was beautiful? The letter proceeded.
</p>

<p>
 I wonder you can bear it. I think of Fleet Street and Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn now
 with a shudder of disgust. There are only two things in the world that make
 life worth living, love and art. I cannot imagine you sitting in an office
 over a ledger, and do you wear a tall hat and an umbrella and a little black
 bag? My feeling is that one should look upon life as an adventure, one should
 burn with the hard, gem-like flame, and one should take risks, one should
 expose oneself to danger. Why do you not go to Paris and study art? I always
 thought you had talent.
</p>

<p>
The suggestion fell in with the possibility that Philip for some time had been
vaguely turning over in his mind. It startled him at first, but he could not
help thinking of it, and in the constant rumination over it he found his only
escape from the wretchedness of his present state. They all thought he had
talent; at Heidelberg they had admired his water colours, Miss Wilkinson had
told him over and over again that they were chasing; even strangers like the
Watsons had been struck by his sketches. La Vie de Boheme had made a deep
impression on him. He had brought it to London and when he was most depressed
he had only to read a few pages to be transported into those chasing attics
where Rodolphe and the rest of them danced and loved and sang. He began to
think of Paris as before he had thought of London, but he had no fear of a
second disillusion; he yearned for romance and beauty and love, and Paris
seemed to offer them all. He had a passion for pictures, and why should he not
be able to paint as well as anybody else? He wrote to Miss Wilkinson and asked
her how much she thought he could live on in Paris. She told him that he could
manage easily on eighty pounds a year, and she enthusiastically approved of his
project. She told him he was too good to be wasted in an office. Who would be a
clerk when he might be a great artist, she asked dramatically, and she besought
Philip to believe in himself: that was the great thing. But Philip had a
cautious nature. It was all very well for Hayward to talk of taking risks, he
had three hundred a year in gilt-edged securities; Philip&rsquo;s entire
fortune amounted to no more than eighteen-hundred pounds. He hesitated.
</p>

<p>
Then it chanced that one day Mr. Goodworthy asked him suddenly if he would like
to go to Paris. The firm did the accounts for a hotel in the Faubourg St.
Honore, which was owned by an English company, and twice a year Mr. Goodworthy
and a clerk went over. The clerk who generally went happened to be ill, and a
press of work prevented any of the others from getting away. Mr. Goodworthy
thought of Philip because he could best be spared, and his articles gave him
some claim upon a job which was one of the pleasures of the business. Philip
was delighted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave to work all day,&rdquo; said Mr. Goodworthy,
&ldquo;but we get our evenings to ourselves, and Paris is Paris.&rdquo; He
smiled in a knowing way. &ldquo;They do us very well at the hotel, and they
give us all our meals, so it don&rsquo;t cost one anything. That&rsquo;s the
way I like going to Paris, at other people&rsquo;s expense.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When they arrived at Calais and Philip saw the crowd of gesticulating porters
his heart leaped.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is the real thing,&rdquo; he said to himself.
</p>

<p>
He was all eyes as the train sped through the country; he adored the sand
dunes, their colour seemed to him more lovely than anything he had ever seen;
and he was enchanted with the canals and the long lines of poplars. When they
got out of the Gare du Nord, and trundled along the cobbled streets in a
ramshackle, noisy cab, it seemed to him that he was breathing a new air so
intoxicating that he could hardly restrain himself from shouting aloud. They
were met at the door of the hotel by the manager, a stout, pleasant man, who
spoke tolerable English; Mr. Goodworthy was an old friend and he greeted them
effusively; they dined in his private room with his wife, and to Philip it
seemed that he had never eaten anything so delicious as the beefsteak aux
pommes, nor drunk such nectar as the vin ordinaire, which were set before them.
</p>

<p>
To Mr. Goodworthy, a respectable householder with excellent principles, the
capital of France was a paradise of the joyously obscene. He asked the manager
next morning what there was to be seen that was &lsquo;thick.&rsquo; He
thoroughly enjoyed these visits of his to Paris; he said they kept you from
growing rusty. In the evenings, after their work was over and they had dined,
he took Philip to the Moulin Rouge and the Folies Bergeres. His little eyes
twinkled and his face wore a sly, sensual smile as he sought out the
pornographic. He went into all the haunts which were specially arranged for the
foreigner, and afterwards said that a nation could come to no good which
permitted that sort of thing. He nudged Philip when at some revue a woman
appeared with practically nothing on, and pointed out to him the most strapping
of the courtesans who walked about the hall. It was a vulgar Paris that he
showed Philip, but Philip saw it with eyes blinded with illusion. In the early
morning he would rush out of the hotel and go to the Champs Elysees, and stand
at the Place de la Concorde. It was June, and Paris was silvery with the
delicacy of the air. Philip felt his heart go out to the people. Here he
thought at last was romance.
</p>

<p>
They spent the inside of a week there, leaving on Sunday, and when Philip late
at night reached his dingy rooms in Barnes his mind was made up; he would
surrender his articles, and go to Paris to study art; but so that no one should
think him unreasonable he determined to stay at the office till his year was
up. He was to have his holiday during the last fortnight in August, and when he
went away he would tell Herbert Carter that he had no intention of returning.
But though Philip could force himself to go to the office every day he could
not even pretend to show any interest in the work. His mind was occupied with
the future. After the middle of July there was nothing much to do and he
escaped a good deal by pretending he had to go to lectures for his first
examination. The time he got in this way he spent in the National Gallery. He
read books about Paris and books about painting. He was steeped in Ruskin. He
read many of Vasari&rsquo;s lives of the painters. He liked that story of
Correggio, and he fancied himself standing before some great masterpiece and
crying: Anch&rsquo; io son&rsquo; pittore. His hesitation had left him now, and
he was convinced that he had in him the makings of a great painter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;After all, I can only try,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;The great
thing in life is to take risks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At last came the middle of August. Mr. Carter was spending the month in
Scotland, and the managing clerk was in charge of the office. Mr. Goodworthy
had seemed pleasantly disposed to Philip since their trip to Paris, and now
that Philip knew he was so soon to be free, he could look upon the funny little
man with tolerance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going for your holiday tomorrow, Carey?&rdquo; he said to
him in the evening.
</p>

<p>
All day Philip had been telling himself that this was the last time he would
ever sit in that hateful office.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, this is the end of my year.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve not done very well. Mr. Carter&rsquo;s
very dissatisfied with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not nearly so dissatisfied as I am with Mr. Carter,&rdquo; returned
Philip cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you should speak like that, Carey.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not coming back. I made the arrangement that if I didn&rsquo;t
like accountancy Mr. Carter would return me half the money I paid for my
articles and I could chuck it at the end of a year.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t come to such a decision hastily.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For ten months I&rsquo;ve loathed it all, I&rsquo;ve loathed the work,
I&rsquo;ve loathed the office, I loathe London. I&rsquo;d rather sweep a
crossing than spend my days here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I must say, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re very fitted for
accountancy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; said Philip, holding out his hand. &ldquo;I want to
thank you for your kindness to me. I&rsquo;m sorry if I&rsquo;ve been
troublesome. I knew almost from the beginning I was no good.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, if you really do make up your mind it is good-bye. I don&rsquo;t
know what you&rsquo;re going to do, but if you&rsquo;re in the neighbourhood at
any time come in and see us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip gave a little laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it sounds very rude, but I hope from the bottom of my
heart that I shall never set eyes on any of you again.&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>XXXIX</h2>

<p>
The Vicar of Blackstable would have nothing to do with the scheme which Philip
laid before him. He had a great idea that one should stick to whatever one had
begun. Like all weak men he laid an exaggerated stress on not changing
one&rsquo;s mind.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You chose to be an accountant of your own free will,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I just took that because it was the only chance I saw of getting up to
town. I hate London, I hate the work, and nothing will induce me to go back to
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Carey were frankly shocked at Philip&rsquo;s idea of being an
artist. He should not forget, they said, that his father and mother were
gentlefolk, and painting wasn&rsquo;t a serious profession; it was Bohemian,
disreputable, immoral. And then Paris!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So long as I have anything to say in the matter, I shall not allow you
to live in Paris,&rdquo; said the Vicar firmly.
</p>

<p>
It was a sink of iniquity. The scarlet woman and she of Babylon flaunted their
vileness there; the cities of the plain were not more wicked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been brought up like a gentleman and Christian, and I
should be false to the trust laid upon me by your dead father and mother if I
allowed you to expose yourself to such temptation.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I know I&rsquo;m not a Christian and I&rsquo;m beginning to doubt
whether I&rsquo;m a gentleman,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
The dispute grew more violent. There was another year before Philip took
possession of his small inheritance, and during that time Mr. Carey proposed
only to give him an allowance if he remained at the office. It was clear to
Philip that if he meant not to continue with accountancy he must leave it while
he could still get back half the money that had been paid for his articles. The
Vicar would not listen. Philip, losing all reserve, said things to wound and
irritate.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got no right to waste my money,&rdquo; he said at last.
&ldquo;After all it&rsquo;s my money, isn&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;m not a child.
You can&rsquo;t prevent me from going to Paris if I make up my mind to. You
can&rsquo;t force me to go back to London.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All I can do is to refuse you money unless you do what I think
fit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t care, I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to go to Paris. I
shall sell my clothes, and my books, and my father&rsquo;s jewellery.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Aunt Louisa sat by in silence, anxious and unhappy. She saw that Philip was
beside himself, and anything she said then would but increase his anger.
Finally the Vicar announced that he wished to hear nothing more about it and
with dignity left the room. For the next three days neither Philip nor he spoke
to one another. Philip wrote to Hayward for information about Paris, and made
up his mind to set out as soon as he got a reply. Mrs. Carey turned the matter
over in her mind incessantly; she felt that Philip included her in the hatred
he bore her husband, and the thought tortured her. She loved him with all her
heart. At length she spoke to him; she listened attentively while he poured out
all his disillusionment of London and his eager ambition for the future.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I may be no good, but at least let me have a try. I can&rsquo;t be a
worse failure than I was in that beastly office. And I feel that I can paint. I
know I&rsquo;ve got it in me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She was not so sure as her husband that they did right in thwarting so strong
an inclination. She had read of great painters whose parents had opposed their
wish to study, the event had shown with what folly; and after all it was just
as possible for a painter to lead a virtuous life to the glory of God as for a
chartered accountant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so afraid of your going to Paris,&rdquo; she said piteously.
&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad if you studied in London.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m going in for painting I must do it thoroughly, and
it&rsquo;s only in Paris that you can get the real thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At his suggestion Mrs. Carey wrote to the solicitor, saying that Philip was
discontented with his work in London, and asking what he thought of a change.
Mr. Nixon answered as follows:
</p>

<p>
Dear Mrs. Carey,
</p>

<p>
I have seen Mr. Herbert Carter, and I am afraid I must tell you that Philip has
not done so well as one could have wished. If he is very strongly set against
the work, perhaps it is better that he should take the opportunity there is now
to break his articles. I am naturally very disappointed, but as you know you
can take a horse to the water, but you can&rsquo;t make him drink.
</p>

<p>
Yours very sincerely,<br/>
  Albert Nixon.
</p>

<p>
The letter was shown to the Vicar, but served only to increase his obstinacy.
He was willing enough that Philip should take up some other profession, he
suggested his father&rsquo;s calling, medicine, but nothing would induce him to
pay an allowance if Philip went to Paris.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mere excuse for self-indulgence and sensuality,&rdquo; he
said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested to hear you blame self-indulgence in others,&rdquo;
retorted Philip acidly.
</p>

<p>
But by this time an answer had come from Hayward, giving the name of a hotel
where Philip could get a room for thirty francs a month and enclosing a note of
introduction to the massiere of a school. Philip read the letter to Mrs. Carey
and told her he proposed to start on the first of September.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t got any money?&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going into Tercanbury this afternoon to sell the
jewellery.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had inherited from his father a gold watch and chain, two or three rings,
some links, and two pins. One of them was a pearl and might fetch a
considerable sum.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very different thing, what a thing&rsquo;s worth and what
it&rsquo;ll fetch,&rdquo; said Aunt Louisa.
</p>

<p>
Philip smiled, for this was one of his uncle&rsquo;s stock phrases.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know, but at the worst I think I can get a hundred pounds on the lot,
and that&rsquo;ll keep me till I&rsquo;m twenty-one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Carey did not answer, but she went upstairs, put on her little black
bonnet, and went to the bank. In an hour she came back. She went to Philip, who
was reading in the drawing-room, and handed him an envelope.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little present for you,&rdquo; she answered, smiling shyly.
</p>

<p>
He opened it and found eleven five-pound notes and a little paper sack bulging
with sovereigns.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t bear to let you sell your father&rsquo;s jewellery.
It&rsquo;s the money I had in the bank. It comes to very nearly a hundred
pounds.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip blushed, and, he knew not why, tears suddenly filled his eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my dear, I can&rsquo;t take it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
most awfully good of you, but I couldn&rsquo;t bear to take it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When Mrs. Carey was married she had three hundred pounds, and this money,
carefully watched, had been used by her to meet any unforeseen expense, any
urgent charity, or to buy Christmas and birthday presents for her husband and
for Philip. In the course of years it had diminished sadly, but it was still
with the Vicar a subject for jesting. He talked of his wife as a rich woman and
he constantly spoke of the &lsquo;nest egg.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, please take it, Philip. I&rsquo;m so sorry I&rsquo;ve been
extravagant, and there&rsquo;s only that left. But it&rsquo;ll make me so happy
if you&rsquo;ll accept it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll want it,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think I shall. I was keeping it in case your uncle
died before me. I thought it would be useful to have a little something I could
get at immediately if I wanted it, but I don&rsquo;t think I shall live very
much longer now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my dear, don&rsquo;t say that. Why, of course you&rsquo;re going to
live for ever. I can&rsquo;t possibly spare you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not sorry.&rdquo; Her voice broke and she hid her eyes,
but in a moment, drying them, she smiled bravely. &ldquo;At first, I used to
pray to God that He might not take me first, because I didn&rsquo;t want your
uncle to be left alone, I didn&rsquo;t want him to have all the suffering, but
now I know that it wouldn&rsquo;t mean so much to your uncle as it would mean
to me. He wants to live more than I do, I&rsquo;ve never been the wife he
wanted, and I daresay he&rsquo;d marry again if anything happened to me. So I
should like to go first. You don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s selfish of me,
Philip, do you? But I couldn&rsquo;t bear it if he went.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip kissed her wrinkled, thin cheek. He did not know why the sight he had of
that overwhelming love made him feel strangely ashamed. It was incomprehensible
that she should care so much for a man who was so indifferent, so selfish, so
grossly self-indulgent; and he divined dimly that in her heart she knew his
indifference and his selfishness, knew them and loved him humbly all the same.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will take the money, Philip?&rdquo; she said, gently stroking his
hand. &ldquo;I know you can do without it, but it&rsquo;ll give me so much
happiness. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do something for you. You see, I never
had a child of my own, and I&rsquo;ve loved you as if you were my son. When you
were a little boy, though I knew it was wicked, I used to wish almost that you
might be ill, so that I could nurse you day and night. But you were only ill
once and then it was at school. I should so like to help you. It&rsquo;s the
only chance I shall ever have. And perhaps some day when you&rsquo;re a great
artist you won&rsquo;t forget me, but you&rsquo;ll remember that I gave you
your start.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very good of you,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very
grateful.&rdquo; A smile came into her tired eyes, a smile of pure happiness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad.&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>XL</h2>

<p>
A few days later Mrs. Carey went to the station to see Philip off. She stood at
the door of the carriage, trying to keep back her tears. Philip was restless
and eager. He wanted to be gone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Kiss me once more,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
He leaned out of the window and kissed her. The train started, and she stood on
the wooden platform of the little station, waving her handkerchief till it was
out of sight. Her heart was dreadfully heavy, and the few hundred yards to the
vicarage seemed very, very long. It was natural enough that he should be eager
to go, she thought, he was a boy and the future beckoned to him; but
she&mdash;she clenched her teeth so that she should not cry. She uttered a
little inward prayer that God would guard him, and keep him out of temptation,
and give him happiness and good fortune.
</p>

<p>
But Philip ceased to think of her a moment after he had settled down in his
carriage. He thought only of the future. He had written to Mrs. Otter, the
massiere to whom Hayward had given him an introduction, and had in his pocket
an invitation to tea on the following day. When he arrived in Paris he had his
luggage put on a cab and trundled off slowly through the gay streets, over the
bridge, and along the narrow ways of the Latin Quarter. He had taken a room at
the Hotel des Deux Ecoles, which was in a shabby street off the Boulevard du
Montparnasse; it was convenient for Amitrano&rsquo;s School at which he was
going to work. A waiter took his box up five flights of stairs, and Philip was
shown into a tiny room, fusty from unopened windows, the greater part of which
was taken up by a large wooden bed with a canopy over it of red rep; there were
heavy curtains on the windows of the same dingy material; the chest of drawers
served also as a washing-stand; and there was a massive wardrobe of the style
which is connected with the good King Louis Philippe. The wall-paper was
discoloured with age; it was dark gray, and there could be vaguely seen on it
garlands of brown leaves. To Philip the room seemed quaint and charming.
</p>

<p>
Though it was late he felt too excited to sleep and, going out, made his way
into the boulevard and walked towards the light. This led him to the station;
and the square in front of it, vivid with arc-lamps, noisy with the yellow
trams that seemed to cross it in all directions, made him laugh aloud with joy.
There were cafes all round, and by chance, thirsty and eager to get a nearer
sight of the crowd, Philip installed himself at a little table outside the Cafe
de Versailles. Every other table was taken, for it was a fine night; and Philip
looked curiously at the people, here little family groups, there a knot of men
with odd-shaped hats and beards talking loudly and gesticulating; next to him
were two men who looked like painters with women who Philip hoped were not
their lawful wives; behind him he heard Americans loudly arguing on art. His
soul was thrilled. He sat till very late, tired out but too happy to move, and
when at last he went to bed he was wide awake; he listened to the manifold
noise of Paris.
</p>

<p>
Next day about tea-time he made his way to the Lion de Belfort, and in a new
street that led out of the Boulevard Raspail found Mrs. Otter. She was an
insignificant woman of thirty, with a provincial air and a deliberately
lady-like manner; she introduced him to her mother. He discovered presently
that she had been studying in Paris for three years and later that she was
separated from her husband. She had in her small drawing-room one or two
portraits which she had painted, and to Philip&rsquo;s inexperience they seemed
extremely accomplished.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder if I shall ever be able to paint as well as that,&rdquo; he
said to her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I expect so,&rdquo; she replied, not without self-satisfaction.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect to do everything all at once, of course.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She was very kind. She gave him the address of a shop where he could get a
portfolio, drawing-paper, and charcoal.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall be going to Amitrano&rsquo;s about nine tomorrow, and if
you&rsquo;ll be there then I&rsquo;ll see that you get a good place and all
that sort of thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She asked him what he wanted to do, and Philip felt that he should not let her
see how vague he was about the whole matter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, first I want to learn to draw,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad to hear you say that. People always want to do things
in such a hurry. I never touched oils till I&rsquo;d been here for two years,
and look at the result.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She gave a glance at the portrait of her mother, a sticky piece of painting
that hung over the piano.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And if I were you, I would be very careful about the people you get to
know. I wouldn&rsquo;t mix myself up with any foreigners. I&rsquo;m very
careful myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip thanked her for the suggestion, but it seemed to him odd. He did not
know that he particularly wanted to be careful.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We live just as we would if we were in England,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Otter&rsquo;s mother, who till then had spoken little. &ldquo;When we came here
we brought all our own furniture over.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip looked round the room. It was filled with a massive suite, and at the
window were the same sort of white lace curtains which Aunt Louisa put up at
the vicarage in summer. The piano was draped in Liberty silk and so was the
chimney-piece. Mrs. Otter followed his wandering eye.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In the evening when we close the shutters one might really feel one was
in England.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And we have our meals just as if we were at home,&rdquo; added her
mother. &ldquo;A meat breakfast in the morning and dinner in the middle of the
day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When he left Mrs. Otter Philip went to buy drawing materials; and next morning
at the stroke of nine, trying to seem self-assured, he presented himself at the
school. Mrs. Otter was already there, and she came forward with a friendly
smile. He had been anxious about the reception he would have as a nouveau, for
he had read a good deal of the rough joking to which a newcomer was exposed at
some of the studios; but Mrs. Otter had reassured him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s nothing like that here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You
see, about half our students are ladies, and they set a tone to the
place.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The studio was large and bare, with gray walls, on which were pinned the
studies that had received prizes. A model was sitting in a chair with a loose
wrap thrown over her, and about a dozen men and women were standing about, some
talking and others still working on their sketch. It was the first rest of the
model.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not try anything too difficult at first,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Otter. &ldquo;Put your easel here. You&rsquo;ll find that&rsquo;s the
easiest pose.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip placed an easel where she indicated, and Mrs. Otter introduced him to a
young woman who sat next to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Carey&mdash;Miss Price. Mr. Carey&rsquo;s never studied before, you
won&rsquo;t mind helping him a little just at first will you?&rdquo; Then she
turned to the model. &ldquo;La Pose.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The model threw aside the paper she had been reading, La Petite Republique, and
sulkily, throwing off her gown, got on to the stand. She stood, squarely on
both feet with her hands clasped behind her head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a stupid pose,&rdquo; said Miss Price. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
imagine why they chose it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When Philip entered, the people in the studio had looked at him curiously, and
the model gave him an indifferent glance, but now they ceased to pay attention
to him. Philip, with his beautiful sheet of paper in front of him, stared
awkwardly at the model. He did not know how to begin. He had never seen a naked
woman before. She was not young and her breasts were shrivelled. She had
colourless, fair hair that fell over her forehead untidily, and her face was
covered with large freckles. He glanced at Miss Price&rsquo;s work. She had
only been working on it two days, and it looked as though she had had trouble;
her paper was in a mess from constant rubbing out, and to Philip&rsquo;s eyes
the figure looked strangely distorted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should have thought I could do as well as that,&rdquo; he said to
himself.
</p>

<p>
He began on the head, thinking that he would work slowly downwards, but, he
could not understand why, he found it infinitely more difficult to draw a head
from the model than to draw one from his imagination. He got into difficulties.
He glanced at Miss Price. She was working with vehement gravity. Her brow was
wrinkled with eagerness, and there was an anxious look in her eyes. It was hot
in the studio, and drops of sweat stood on her forehead. She was a girl of
twenty-six, with a great deal of dull gold hair; it was handsome hair, but it
was carelessly done, dragged back from her forehead and tied in a hurried knot.
She had a large face, with broad, flat features and small eyes; her skin was
pasty, with a singular unhealthiness of tone, and there was no colour in the
cheeks. She had an unwashed air and you could not help wondering if she slept
in her clothes. She was serious and silent. When the next pause came, she
stepped back to look at her work.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m having so much bother,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;But I mean to get it right.&rdquo; She turned to Philip. &ldquo;How are
you getting on?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he answered, with a rueful smile.
</p>

<p>
She looked at what he had done.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect to do anything that way. You must take
measurements. And you must square out your paper.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She showed him rapidly how to set about the business. Philip was impressed by
her earnestness, but repelled by her want of charm. He was grateful for the
hints she gave him and set to work again. Meanwhile other people had come in,
mostly men, for the women always arrived first, and the studio for the time of
year (it was early yet) was fairly full. Presently there came in a young man
with thin, black hair, an enormous nose, and a face so long that it reminded
you of a horse. He sat down next to Philip and nodded across him to Miss Price.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very late,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Are you only just
up?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was such a splendid day, I thought I&rsquo;d lie in bed and think how
beautiful it was out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip smiled, but Miss Price took the remark seriously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That seems a funny thing to do, I should have thought it would be more
to the point to get up and enjoy it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The way of the humorist is very hard,&rdquo; said the young man gravely.
</p>

<p>
He did not seem inclined to work. He looked at his canvas; he was working in
colour, and had sketched in the day before the model who was posing. He turned
to Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you just come out from England?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How did you find your way to Amitrano&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was the only school I knew of.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope you haven&rsquo;t come with the idea that you will learn anything
here which will be of the smallest use to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best school in Paris,&rdquo; said Miss Price.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only one where they take art seriously.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Should art be taken seriously?&rdquo; the young man asked; and since
Miss Price replied only with a scornful shrug, he added: &ldquo;But the point
is, all schools are bad. They are academical, obviously. Why this is less
injurious than most is that the teaching is more incompetent than elsewhere.
Because you learn nothing….&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why d&rsquo;you come here then?&rdquo; interrupted Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see the better course, but do not follow it. Miss Price, who is
cultured, will remember the Latin of that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish you would leave me out of your conversation, Mr. Clutton,&rdquo;
said Miss Price brusquely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The only way to learn to paint,&rdquo; he went on, imperturbable,
&ldquo;is to take a studio, hire a model, and just fight it out for
yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That seems a simple thing to do,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It only needs money,&rdquo; replied Clutton.
</p>

<p>
He began to paint, and Philip looked at him from the corner of his eye. He was
long and desperately thin; his huge bones seemed to protrude from his body; his
elbows were so sharp that they appeared to jut out through the arms of his
shabby coat. His trousers were frayed at the bottom, and on each of his boots
was a clumsy patch. Miss Price got up and went over to Philip&rsquo;s easel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If Mr. Clutton will hold his tongue for a moment, I&rsquo;ll just help
you a little,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Miss Price dislikes me because I have humour,&rdquo; said Clutton,
looking meditatively at his canvas, &ldquo;but she detests me because I have
genius.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He spoke with solemnity, and his colossal, misshapen nose made what he said
very quaint. Philip was obliged to laugh, but Miss Price grew darkly red with
anger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only person who has ever accused you of genius.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Also I am the only person whose opinion is of the least value to
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Price began to criticise what Philip had done. She talked glibly of
anatomy and construction, planes and lines, and of much else which Philip did
not understand. She had been at the studio a long time and knew the main points
which the masters insisted upon, but though she could show what was wrong with
Philip&rsquo;s work she could not tell him how to put it right.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully kind of you to take so much trouble with me,&rdquo;
said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; she answered, flushing awkwardly.
&ldquo;People did the same for me when I first came, I&rsquo;d do it for
anyone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Miss Price wants to indicate that she is giving you the advantage of her
knowledge from a sense of duty rather than on account of any charms of your
person,&rdquo; said Clutton.
</p>

<p>
Miss Price gave him a furious look, and went back to her own drawing. The clock
struck twelve, and the model with a cry of relief stepped down from the stand.
</p>

<p>
Miss Price gathered up her things.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Some of us go to Gravier&rsquo;s for lunch,&rdquo; she said to Philip,
with a look at Clutton. &ldquo;I always go home myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you to Gravier&rsquo;s if you like,&rdquo; said Clutton.
</p>

<p>
Philip thanked him and made ready to go. On his way out Mrs. Otter asked him
how he had been getting on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did Fanny Price help you?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I put you there
because I know she can do it if she likes. She&rsquo;s a disagreeable,
ill-natured girl, and she can&rsquo;t draw herself at all, but she knows the
ropes, and she can be useful to a newcomer if she cares to take the
trouble.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
On the way down the street Clutton said to him:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made an impression on Fanny Price. You&rsquo;d better look
out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip laughed. He had never seen anyone on whom he wished less to make an
impression. They came to the cheap little restaurant at which several of the
students ate, and Clutton sat down at a table at which three or four men were
already seated. For a franc, they got an egg, a plate of meat, cheese, and a
small bottle of wine. Coffee was extra. They sat on the pavement, and yellow
trams passed up and down the boulevard with a ceaseless ringing of bells.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By the way, what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; said Clutton, as they took
their seats.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Carey.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Allow me to introduce an old and trusted friend, Carey by name,&rdquo;
said Clutton gravely. &ldquo;Mr. Flanagan, Mr. Lawson.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They laughed and went on with their conversation. They talked of a thousand
things, and they all talked at once. No one paid the smallest attention to
anyone else. They talked of the places they had been to in the summer, of
studios, of the various schools; they mentioned names which were unfamiliar to
Philip, Monet, Manet, Renoir, Pissarro, Degas. Philip listened with all his
ears, and though he felt a little out of it, his heart leaped with exultation.
The time flew. When Clutton got up he said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I expect you&rsquo;ll find me here this evening if you care to come.
You&rsquo;ll find this about the best place for getting dyspepsia at the lowest
cost in the Quarter.&rdquo;
</p>

<h2>XLI</h2>

<p>
Philip walked down the Boulevard du Montparnasse. It was not at all like the
Paris he had seen in the spring during his visit to do the accounts of the
Hotel St. Georges&mdash;he thought already of that part of his life with a
shudder&mdash;but reminded him of what he thought a provincial town must be.
There was an easy-going air about it, and a sunny spaciousness which invited
the mind to day-dreaming. The trimness of the trees, the vivid whiteness of the
houses, the breadth, were very agreeable; and he felt himself already
thoroughly at home. He sauntered along, staring at the people; there seemed an
elegance about the most ordinary, workmen with their broad red sashes and their
wide trousers, little soldiers in dingy, charming uniforms. He came presently
to the Avenue de l&rsquo;Observatoire, and he gave a sigh of pleasure at the
magnificent, yet so graceful, vista. He came to the gardens of the Luxembourg:
children were playing, nurses with long ribbons walked slowly two by two, busy
men passed through with satchels under their arms, youths strangely dressed.
The scene was formal and dainty; nature was arranged and ordered, but so
exquisitely, that nature unordered and unarranged seemed barbaric. Philip was
enchanted. It excited him to stand on that spot of which he had read so much;
it was classic ground to him; and he felt the awe and the delight which some
old don might feel when for the first time he looked on the smiling plain of
Sparta.
</p>

<p>
As he wandered he chanced to see Miss Price sitting by herself on a bench. He
hesitated, for he did not at that moment want to see anyone, and her uncouth
way seemed out of place amid the happiness he felt around him; but he had
divined her sensitiveness to affront, and since she had seen him thought it
would be polite to speak to her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; she said, as he came up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Enjoying myself. Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I come here every day from four to five. I don&rsquo;t think one
does any good if one works straight through.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;May I sit down for a minute?&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you want to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t sound very cordial,&rdquo; he laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not much of a one for saying pretty things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip, a little disconcerted, was silent as he lit a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did Clutton say anything about my work?&rdquo; she asked suddenly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think he did,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s no good, you know. He thinks he&rsquo;s a genius, but he
isn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s too lazy, for one thing. Genius is an infinite capacity
for taking pains. The only thing is to peg away. If one only makes up
one&rsquo;s mind badly enough to do a thing one can&rsquo;t help doing
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She spoke with a passionate strenuousness which was rather striking. She wore a
sailor hat of black straw, a white blouse which was not quite clean, and a
brown skirt. She had no gloves on, and her hands wanted washing. She was so
unattractive that Philip wished he had not begun to talk to her. He could not
make out whether she wanted him to stay or go.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything I can for you,&rdquo; she said all at once,
without reference to anything that had gone before. &ldquo;I know how hard it
is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; said Philip, then in a moment:
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come and have tea with me somewhere?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked at him quickly and flushed. When she reddened her pasty skin
acquired a curiously mottled look, like strawberries and cream that had gone
bad.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, thanks. What d&rsquo;you think I want tea for? I&rsquo;ve only just
had lunch.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought it would pass the time,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you find it long you needn&rsquo;t bother about me, you know. I
don&rsquo;t mind being left alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At that moment two men passed, in brown velveteens, enormous trousers, and
basque caps. They were young, but both wore beards.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, are those art-students?&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;They might
have stepped out of the Vie de Boheme.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re Americans,&rdquo; said Miss Price scornfully.
&ldquo;Frenchmen haven&rsquo;t worn things like that for thirty years, but the
Americans from the Far West buy those clothes and have themselves photographed
the day after they arrive in Paris. That&rsquo;s about as near to art as they
ever get. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter to them, they&rsquo;ve all got
money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip liked the daring picturesqueness of the Americans&rsquo; costume; he
thought it showed the romantic spirit. Miss Price asked him the time.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must be getting along to the studio,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Are you
going to the sketch classes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip did not know anything about them, and she told him that from five to six
every evening a model sat, from whom anyone who liked could go and draw at the
cost of fifty centimes. They had a different model every day, and it was very
good practice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;re good enough yet for that. You&rsquo;d
better wait a bit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why I shouldn&rsquo;t try. I haven&rsquo;t got
anything else to do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They got up and walked to the studio. Philip could not tell from her manner
whether Miss Price wished him to walk with her or preferred to walk alone. He
remained from sheer embarrassment, not knowing how to leave her; but she would
not talk; she answered his questions in an ungracious manner.
</p>

<p>
A man was standing at the studio door with a large dish into which each person
as he went in dropped his half franc. The studio was much fuller than it had
been in the morning, and there was not the preponderance of English and
Americans; nor were women there in so large a proportion. Philip felt the
assemblage was more the sort of thing he had expected. It was very warm, and
the air quickly grew fetid. It was an old man who sat this time, with a vast
gray beard, and Philip tried to put into practice the little he had learned in
the morning; but he made a poor job of it; he realised that he could not draw
nearly as well as he thought. He glanced enviously at one or two sketches of
men who sat near him, and wondered whether he would ever be able to use the
charcoal with that mastery. The hour passed quickly. Not wishing to press
himself upon Miss Price he sat down at some distance from her, and at the end,
as he passed her on his way out, she asked him brusquely how he had got on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not very well,&rdquo; he smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d condescended to come and sit near me I could have given
you some hints. I suppose you thought yourself too grand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t that. I was afraid you&rsquo;d think me a
nuisance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When I do that I&rsquo;ll tell you sharp enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip saw that in her uncouth way she was offering him help.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, tomorrow I&rsquo;ll just force myself upon you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; she answered.
</p>

<p>
Philip went out and wondered what he should do with himself till dinner. He was
eager to do something characteristic. Absinthe! of course it was indicated, and
so, sauntering towards the station, he seated himself outside a cafe and
ordered it. He drank with nausea and satisfaction. He found the taste
disgusting, but the moral effect magnificent; he felt every inch an
art-student; and since he drank on an empty stomach his spirits presently grew
very high. He watched the crowds, and felt all men were his brothers. He was
happy. When he reached Gravier&rsquo;s the table at which Clutton sat was full,
but as soon as he saw Philip limping along he called out to him. They made
room. The dinner was frugal, a plate of soup, a dish of meat, fruit, cheese,
and half a bottle of wine; but Philip paid no attention to what he ate. He took
note of the men at the table. Flanagan was there again: he was an American, a
short, snub-nosed youth with a jolly face and a laughing mouth. He wore a
Norfolk jacket of bold pattern, a blue stock round his neck, and a tweed cap of
fantastic shape. At that time impressionism reigned in the Latin Quarter, but
its victory over the older schools was still recent; and Carolus-Duran,
Bouguereau, and their like were set up against Manet, Monet, and Degas. To
appreciate these was still a sign of grace. Whistler was an influence strong
with the English and his compatriots, and the discerning collected Japanese
prints. The old masters were tested by new standards. The esteem in which
Raphael had been for centuries held was a matter of derision to wise young men.
They offered to give all his works for Velasquez&rsquo; head of Philip IV in
the National Gallery. Philip found that a discussion on art was raging. Lawson,
whom he had met at luncheon, sat opposite to him. He was a thin youth with a
freckled face and red hair. He had very bright green eyes. As Philip sat down
he fixed them on him and remarked suddenly:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Raphael was only tolerable when he painted other people&rsquo;s
pictures. When he painted Peruginos or Pinturichios he was charming; when he
painted Raphaels he was,&rdquo; with a scornful shrug, &ldquo;Raphael.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lawson spoke so aggressively that Philip was taken aback, but he was not
obliged to answer because Flanagan broke in impatiently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, to hell with art!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get
ginny.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You were ginny last night, Flanagan,&rdquo; said Lawson.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing to what I mean to be tonight,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Fancy
being in Pa-ris and thinking of nothing but art all the time.&rdquo; He spoke
with a broad Western accent. &ldquo;My, it is good to be alive.&rdquo; He
gathered himself together and then banged his fist on the table. &ldquo;To hell
with art, I say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You not only say it, but you say it with tiresome iteration,&rdquo; said
Clutton severely.
</p>

<p>
There was another American at the table. He was dressed like those fine fellows
whom Philip had seen that afternoon in the Luxembourg. He had a handsome face,
thin, ascetic, with dark eyes; he wore his fantastic garb with the dashing air
of a buccaneer. He had a vast quantity of dark hair which fell constantly over
his eyes, and his most frequent gesture was to throw back his head dramatically
to get some long wisp out of the way. He began to talk of the Olympia by Manet,
which then hung in the Luxembourg.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I stood in front of it for an hour today, and I tell you it&rsquo;s not
a good picture.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lawson put down his knife and fork. His green eyes flashed fire, he gasped with
rage; but he could be seen imposing calm upon himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very interesting to hear the mind of the untutored
savage,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Will you tell us why it isn&rsquo;t a good
picture?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Before the American could answer someone else broke in vehemently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you mean to say you can look at the painting of that flesh and
say it&rsquo;s not good?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that. I think the right breast is very well
painted.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The right breast be damned,&rdquo; shouted Lawson. &ldquo;The whole
thing&rsquo;s a miracle of painting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He began to describe in detail the beauties of the picture, but at this table
at Gravier&rsquo;s they who spoke at length spoke for their own edification. No
one listened to him. The American interrupted angrily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you think the head&rsquo;s good?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lawson, white with passion now, began to defend the head; but Clutton, who had
been sitting in silence with a look on his face of good-humoured scorn, broke
in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give him the head. We don&rsquo;t want the head. It doesn&rsquo;t affect
the picture.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll give you the head,&rdquo; cried Lawson.
&ldquo;Take the head and be damned to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What about the black line?&rdquo; cried the American, triumphantly
pushing back a wisp of hair which nearly fell in his soup. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t see a black line round objects in nature.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, God, send down fire from heaven to consume the blasphemer,&rdquo;
said Lawson. &ldquo;What has nature got to do with it? No one knows
what&rsquo;s in nature and what isn&rsquo;t! The world sees nature through the
eyes of the artist. Why, for centuries it saw horses jumping a fence with all
their legs extended, and by Heaven, sir, they were extended. It saw shadows
black until Monet discovered they were coloured, and by Heaven, sir, they were
black. If we choose to surround objects with a black line, the world will see
the black line, and there will be a black line; and if we paint grass red and
cows blue, it&rsquo;ll see them red and blue, and, by Heaven, they will be red
and blue.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To hell with art,&rdquo; murmured Flanagan. &ldquo;I want to get
ginny.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lawson took no notice of the interruption.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now look here, when Olympia was shown at the Salon, Zola&mdash;amid the
jeers of the Philistines and the hisses of the pompiers, the academicians, and
the public, Zola said: &lsquo;I look forward to the day when Manet&rsquo;s
picture will hang in the Louvre opposite the Odalisque of Ingres, and it will
not be the Odalisque which will gain by comparison.&rsquo; It&rsquo;ll be
there. Every day I see the time grow nearer. In ten years the Olympia will be
in the Louvre.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; shouted the American, using both hands now with a sudden
desperate attempt to get his hair once for all out of the way. &ldquo;In ten
years that picture will be dead. It&rsquo;s only a fashion of the moment. No
picture can live that hasn&rsquo;t got something which that picture misses by a
million miles.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Great art can&rsquo;t exist without a moral element.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh God!&rdquo; cried Lawson furiously. &ldquo;I knew it was that. He
wants morality.&rdquo; He joined his hands and held them towards heaven in
supplication. &ldquo;Oh, Christopher Columbus, Christopher Columbus, what did
you do when you discovered America?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ruskin says…&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But before he could add another word, Clutton rapped with the handle of his
knife imperiously on the table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said in a stern voice, and his huge nose positively
wrinkled with passion, &ldquo;a name has been mentioned which I never thought
to hear again in decent society. Freedom of speech is all very well, but we
must observe the limits of common propriety. You may talk of Bouguereau if you
will: there is a cheerful disgustingness in the sound which excites laughter;
but let us not sully our chaste lips with the names of J. Ruskin, G. F. Watts,
or E. B. Jones.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who was Ruskin anyway?&rdquo; asked Flanagan.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He was one of the Great Victorians. He was a master of English
style.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ruskin&rsquo;s style&mdash;a thing of shreds and purple patches,&rdquo;
said Lawson. &ldquo;Besides, damn the Great Victorians. Whenever I open a paper
and see Death of a Great Victorian, I thank Heaven there&rsquo;s one more of
them gone. Their only talent was longevity, and no artist should be allowed to
live after he&rsquo;s forty; by then a man has done his best work, all he does
after that is repetition. Don&rsquo;t you think it was the greatest luck in the
world for them that Keats, Shelley, Bonnington, and Byron died early? What a
genius we should think Swinburne if he had perished on the day the first series
of Poems and Ballads was published!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The suggestion pleased, for no one at the table was more than twenty-four, and
they threw themselves upon it with gusto. They were unanimous for once. They
elaborated. Someone proposed a vast bonfire made out of the works of the Forty
Academicians into which the Great Victorians might be hurled on their fortieth
birthday. The idea was received with acclamation. Carlyle and Ruskin, Tennyson,
Browning, G. F. Watts, E. B. Jones, Dickens, Thackeray, they were hurried into
the flames; Mr. Gladstone, John Bright, and Cobden; there was a moment&rsquo;s
discussion about George Meredith, but Matthew Arnold and Emerson were given up
cheerfully. At last came Walter Pater.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not Walter Pater,&rdquo; murmured Philip.
</p>

<p>
Lawson stared at him for a moment with his green eyes and then nodded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite right, Walter Pater is the only justification for
Mona Lisa. D&rsquo;you know Cronshaw? He used to know Pater.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Cronshaw?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Cronshaw&rsquo;s a poet. He lives here. Let&rsquo;s go to the
Lilas.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
La Closerie des Lilas was a cafe to which they often went in the evening after
dinner, and here Cronshaw was invariably to be found between the hours of nine
at night and two in the morning. But Flanagan had had enough of intellectual
conversation for one evening, and when Lawson made his suggestion, turned to
Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh gee, let&rsquo;s go where there are girls,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Come to the Gaite Montparnasse, and we&rsquo;ll get ginny.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather go and see Cronshaw and keep sober,&rdquo; laughed
Philip.
</p>

<h2>XLII</h2>

<p>
There was a general disturbance. Flanagan and two or three more went on to the
music-hall, while Philip walked slowly with Clutton and Lawson to the Closerie
des Lilas.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must go to the Gaite Montparnasse,&rdquo; said Lawson to him.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the loveliest things in Paris. I&rsquo;m going to
paint it one of these days.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip, influenced by Hayward, looked upon music-halls with scornful eyes, but
he had reached Paris at a time when their artistic possibilities were just
discovered. The peculiarities of lighting, the masses of dingy red and
tarnished gold, the heaviness of the shadows and the decorative lines, offered
a new theme; and half the studios in the Quarter contained sketches made in one
or other of the local theatres. Men of letters, following in the
painters&rsquo; wake, conspired suddenly to find artistic value in the turns;
and red-nosed comedians were lauded to the skies for their sense of character;
fat female singers, who had bawled obscurely for twenty years, were discovered
to possess inimitable drollery; there were those who found an aesthetic delight
in performing dogs; while others exhausted their vocabulary to extol the
distinction of conjurers and trick-cyclists. The crowd too, under another
influence, was become an object of sympathetic interest. With Hayward, Philip
had disdained humanity in the mass; he adopted the attitude of one who wraps
himself in solitariness and watches with disgust the antics of the vulgar; but
Clutton and Lawson talked of the multitude with enthusiasm. They described the
seething throng that filled the various fairs of Paris, the sea of faces, half
seen in the glare of acetylene, half hidden in the darkness, and the blare of
trumpets, the hooting of whistles, the hum of voices. What they said was new
and strange to Philip. They told him about Cronshaw.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you ever read any of his work?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It came out in The Yellow Book.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They looked upon him, as painters often do writers, with contempt because he
was a layman, with tolerance because he practised an art, and with awe because
he used a medium in which themselves felt ill-at-ease.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an extraordinary fellow. You&rsquo;ll find him a bit
disappointing at first, he only comes out at his best when he&rsquo;s
drunk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the nuisance is,&rdquo; added Clutton, &ldquo;that it takes him a
devil of a time to get drunk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When they arrived at the cafe Lawson told Philip that they would have to go in.
There was hardly a bite in the autumn air, but Cronshaw had a morbid fear of
draughts and even in the warmest weather sat inside.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He knows everyone worth knowing,&rdquo; Lawson explained. &ldquo;He knew
Pater and Oscar Wilde, and he knows Mallarme and all those fellows.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The object of their search sat in the most sheltered corner of the cafe, with
his coat on and the collar turned up. He wore his hat pressed well down on his
forehead so that he should avoid cold air. He was a big man, stout but not
obese, with a round face, a small moustache, and little, rather stupid eyes.
His head did not seem quite big enough for his body. It looked like a pea
uneasily poised on an egg. He was playing dominoes with a Frenchman, and
greeted the new-comers with a quiet smile; he did not speak, but as if to make
room for them pushed away the little pile of saucers on the table which
indicated the number of drinks he had already consumed. He nodded to Philip
when he was introduced to him, and went on with the game. Philip&rsquo;s
knowledge of the language was small, but he knew enough to tell that Cronshaw,
although he had lived in Paris for several years, spoke French execrably.
</p>

<p>
At last he leaned back with a smile of triumph.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Je vous ai battu,&rdquo; he said, with an abominable accent.
&ldquo;Garcong!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He called the waiter and turned to Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just out from England? See any cricket?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was a little confused at the unexpected question.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Cronshaw knows the averages of every first-class cricketer for the last
twenty years,&rdquo; said Lawson, smiling.
</p>

<p>
The Frenchman left them for friends at another table, and Cronshaw, with the
lazy enunciation which was one of his peculiarities, began to discourse on the
relative merits of Kent and Lancashire. He told them of the last test match he
had seen and described the course of the game wicket by wicket.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only thing I miss in Paris,&rdquo; he said, as he
finished the bock which the waiter had brought. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t get any
cricket.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was disappointed, and Lawson, pardonably anxious to show off one of the
celebrities of the Quarter, grew impatient. Cronshaw was taking his time to
wake up that evening, though the saucers at his side indicated that he had at
least made an honest attempt to get drunk. Clutton watched the scene with
amusement. He fancied there was something of affectation in Cronshaw&rsquo;s
minute knowledge of cricket; he liked to tantalise people by talking to them of
things that obviously bored them; Clutton threw in a question.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you seen Mallarme lately?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Cronshaw looked at him slowly, as if he were turning the inquiry over in his
mind, and before he answered rapped on the marble table with one of the
saucers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bring my bottle of whiskey,&rdquo; he called out. He turned again to
Philip. &ldquo;I keep my own bottle of whiskey. I can&rsquo;t afford to pay
fifty centimes for every thimbleful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The waiter brought the bottle, and Cronshaw held it up to the light.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been drinking it. Waiter, who&rsquo;s been helping himself
to my whiskey?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mais personne, Monsieur Cronshaw.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I made a mark on it last night, and look at it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Monsieur made a mark, but he kept on drinking after that. At that rate
Monsieur wastes his time in making marks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The waiter was a jovial fellow and knew Cronshaw intimately. Cronshaw gazed at
him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you give me your word of honour as a nobleman and a gentleman that
nobody but I has been drinking my whiskey, I&rsquo;ll accept your
statement.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This remark, translated literally into the crudest French, sounded very funny,
and the lady at the comptoir could not help laughing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Il est impayable,&rdquo; she murmured.
</p>

<p>
Cronshaw, hearing her, turned a sheepish eye upon her; she was stout, matronly,
and middle-aged; and solemnly kissed his hand to her. She shrugged her
shoulders.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fear not, madam,&rdquo; he said heavily. &ldquo;I have passed the age
when I am tempted by forty-five and gratitude.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He poured himself out some whiskey and water, and slowly drank it. He wiped his
mouth with the back of his hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He talked very well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lawson and Clutton knew that Cronshaw&rsquo;s remark was an answer to the
question about Mallarme. Cronshaw often went to the gatherings on Tuesday
evenings when the poet received men of letters and painters, and discoursed
with subtle oratory on any subject that was suggested to him. Cronshaw had
evidently been there lately.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He talked very well, but he talked nonsense. He talked about art as
though it were the most important thing in the world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t, what are we here for?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What you&rsquo;re here for I don&rsquo;t know. It is no business of
mine. But art is a luxury. Men attach importance only to self-preservation and
the propagation of their species. It is only when these instincts are satisfied
that they consent to occupy themselves with the entertainment which is provided
for them by writers, painters, and poets.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Cronshaw stopped for a moment to drink. He had pondered for twenty years the
problem whether he loved liquor because it made him talk or whether he loved
conversation because it made him thirsty.
</p>

<p>
Then he said: &ldquo;I wrote a poem yesterday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Without being asked he began to recite it, very slowly, marking the rhythm with
an extended forefinger. It was possibly a very fine poem, but at that moment a
young woman came in. She had scarlet lips, and it was plain that the vivid
colour of her cheeks was not due to the vulgarity of nature; she had blackened
her eyelashes and eyebrows, and painted both eyelids a bold blue, which was
continued to a triangle at the corner of the eyes. It was fantastic and
amusing. Her dark hair was done over her ears in the fashion made popular by
Mlle. Cleo de Merode. Philip&rsquo;s eyes wandered to her, and Cronshaw, having
finished the recitation of his verses, smiled upon him indulgently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You were not listening,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, I was.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not blame you, for you have given an apt illustration of the
statement I just made. What is art beside love? I respect and applaud your
indifference to fine poetry when you can contemplate the meretricious charms of
this young person.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She passed by the table at which they were sitting, and he took her arm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come and sit by my side, dear child, and let us play the divine comedy
of love.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fichez-moi la paix,&rdquo; she said, and pushing him on one side
continued her perambulation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Art,&rdquo; he continued, with a wave of the hand, &ldquo;is merely the
refuge which the ingenious have invented, when they were supplied with food and
women, to escape the tediousness of life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Cronshaw filled his glass again, and began to talk at length. He spoke with
rotund delivery. He chose his words carefully. He mingled wisdom and nonsense
in the most astounding manner, gravely making fun of his hearers at one moment,
and at the next playfully giving them sound advice. He talked of art, and
literature, and life. He was by turns devout and obscene, merry and lachrymose.
He grew remarkably drunk, and then he began to recite poetry, his own and
Milton&rsquo;s, his own and Shelley&rsquo;s, his own and Kit Marlowe&rsquo;s.
</p>

<p>
At last Lawson, exhausted, got up to go home.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall go too,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
Clutton, the most silent of them all, remained behind listening, with a
sardonic smile on his lips, to Cronshaw&rsquo;s maunderings. Lawson accompanied
Philip to his hotel and then bade him good-night. But when Philip got to bed he
could not sleep. All these new ideas that had been flung before him carelessly
seethed in his brain. He was tremendously excited. He felt in himself great
powers. He had never before been so self-confident.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know I shall be a great artist,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;I
feel it in me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A thrill passed through him as another thought came, but even to himself he
would not put it into words:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By George, I believe I&rsquo;ve got genius.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was in fact very drunk, but as he had not taken more than one glass of beer,
it could have been due only to a more dangerous intoxicant than alcohol.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>XLIII</h2>

<p>
On Tuesdays and Fridays masters spent the morning at Amitrano&rsquo;s,
criticising the work done. In France the painter earns little unless he paints
portraits and is patronised by rich Americans; and men of reputation are glad
to increase their incomes by spending two or three hours once a week at one of
the numerous studios where art is taught. Tuesday was the day upon which Michel
Rollin came to Amitrano&rsquo;s. He was an elderly man, with a white beard and
a florid complexion, who had painted a number of decorations for the State, but
these were an object of derision to the students he instructed: he was a
disciple of Ingres, impervious to the progress of art and angrily impatient
with that tas de farceurs whose names were Manet, Degas, Monet, and Sisley; but
he was an excellent teacher, helpful, polite, and encouraging. Foinet, on the
other hand, who visited the studio on Fridays, was a difficult man to get on
with. He was a small, shrivelled person, with bad teeth and a bilious air, an
untidy gray beard, and savage eyes; his voice was high and his tone sarcastic.
He had had pictures bought by the Luxembourg, and at twenty-five looked forward
to a great career; but his talent was due to youth rather than to personality,
and for twenty years he had done nothing but repeat the landscape which had
brought him his early success. When he was reproached with monotony, he
answered:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Corot only painted one thing. Why shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was envious of everyone else&rsquo;s success, and had a peculiar, personal
loathing of the impressionists; for he looked upon his own failure as due to
the mad fashion which had attracted the public, sale bete, to their works. The
genial disdain of Michel Rollin, who called them impostors, was answered by him
with vituperation, of which crapule and canaille were the least violent items;
he amused himself with abuse of their private lives, and with sardonic humour,
with blasphemous and obscene detail, attacked the legitimacy of their births
and the purity of their conjugal relations: he used an Oriental imagery and an
Oriental emphasis to accentuate his ribald scorn. Nor did he conceal his
contempt for the students whose work he examined. By them he was hated and
feared; the women by his brutal sarcasm he reduced often to tears, which again
aroused his ridicule; and he remained at the studio, notwithstanding the
protests of those who suffered too bitterly from his attacks, because there
could be no doubt that he was one of the best masters in Paris. Sometimes the
old model who kept the school ventured to remonstrate with him, but his
expostulations quickly gave way before the violent insolence of the painter to
abject apologies.
</p>

<p>
It was Foinet with whom Philip first came in contact. He was already in the
studio when Philip arrived. He went round from easel to easel, with Mrs. Otter,
the massiere, by his side to interpret his remarks for the benefit of those who
could not understand French. Fanny Price, sitting next to Philip, was working
feverishly. Her face was sallow with nervousness, and every now and then she
stopped to wipe her hands on her blouse; for they were hot with anxiety.
Suddenly she turned to Philip with an anxious look, which she tried to hide by
a sullen frown.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you think it&rsquo;s good?&rdquo; she asked, nodding at her
drawing.
</p>

<p>
Philip got up and looked at it. He was astounded; he felt she must have no eye
at all; the thing was hopelessly out of drawing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish I could draw half as well myself,&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect to, you&rsquo;ve only just come. It&rsquo;s a bit
too much to expect that you should draw as well as I do. I&rsquo;ve been here
two years.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fanny Price puzzled Philip. Her conceit was stupendous. Philip had already
discovered that everyone in the studio cordially disliked her; and it was no
wonder, for she seemed to go out of her way to wound people.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I complained to Mrs. Otter about Foinet,&rdquo; she said now. &ldquo;The
last two weeks he hasn&rsquo;t looked at my drawings. He spends about half an
hour on Mrs. Otter because she&rsquo;s the massiere. After all I pay as much as
anybody else, and I suppose my money&rsquo;s as good as theirs. I don&rsquo;t
see why I shouldn&rsquo;t get as much attention as anybody else.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She took up her charcoal again, but in a moment put it down with a groan.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do any more now. I&rsquo;m so frightfully nervous.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked at Foinet, who was coming towards them with Mrs. Otter. Mrs. Otter,
meek, mediocre, and self-satisfied, wore an air of importance. Foinet sat down
at the easel of an untidy little Englishwoman called Ruth Chalice. She had the
fine black eyes, languid but passionate, the thin face, ascetic but sensual,
the skin like old ivory, which under the influence of Burne-Jones were
cultivated at that time by young ladies in Chelsea. Foinet seemed in a pleasant
mood; he did not say much to her, but with quick, determined strokes of her
charcoal pointed out her errors. Miss Chalice beamed with pleasure when he
rose. He came to Clutton, and by this time Philip was nervous too but Mrs.
Otter had promised to make things easy for him. Foinet stood for a moment in
front of Clutton&rsquo;s work, biting his thumb silently, then absent-mindedly
spat out upon the canvas the little piece of skin which he had bitten off.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine line,&rdquo; he said at last, indicating with his
thumb what pleased him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re beginning to learn to draw.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Clutton did not answer, but looked at the master with his usual air of sardonic
indifference to the world&rsquo;s opinion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to think you have at least a trace of talent.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Otter, who did not like Clutton, pursed her lips. She did not see anything
out of the way in his work. Foinet sat down and went into technical details.
Mrs. Otter grew rather tired of standing. Clutton did not say anything, but
nodded now and then, and Foinet felt with satisfaction that he grasped what he
said and the reasons of it; most of them listened to him, but it was clear they
never understood. Then Foinet got up and came to Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He only arrived two days ago,&rdquo; Mrs. Otter hurried to explain.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a beginner. He&rsquo;s never studied before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ca se voit,&rdquo; the master said. &ldquo;One sees that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He passed on, and Mrs. Otter murmured to him:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is the young lady I told you about.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked at her as though she were some repulsive animal, and his voice grew
more rasping.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It appears that you do not think I pay enough attention to you. You have
been complaining to the massiere. Well, show me this work to which you wish me
to give attention.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fanny Price coloured. The blood under her unhealthy skin seemed to be of a
strange purple. Without answering she pointed to the drawing on which she had
been at work since the beginning of the week. Foinet sat down.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what do you wish me to say to you? Do you wish me to tell you it
is good? It isn&rsquo;t. Do you wish me to tell you it is well drawn? It
isn&rsquo;t. Do you wish me to say it has merit? It hasn&rsquo;t. Do you wish
me to show you what is wrong with it? It is all wrong. Do you wish me to tell
you what to do with it? Tear it up. Are you satisfied now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Price became very white. She was furious because he had said all this
before Mrs. Otter. Though she had been in France so long and could understand
French well enough, she could hardly speak two words.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got no right to treat me like that. My money&rsquo;s as good
as anyone else&rsquo;s. I pay him to teach me. That&rsquo;s not teaching
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What does she say? What does she say?&rdquo; asked Foinet.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Otter hesitated to translate, and Miss Price repeated in execrable French.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Je vous paye pour m&rsquo;apprendre.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His eyes flashed with rage, he raised his voice and shook his fist.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mais, nom de Dieu, I can&rsquo;t teach you. I could more easily teach a
camel.&rdquo; He turned to Mrs. Otter. &ldquo;Ask her, does she do this for
amusement, or does she expect to earn money by it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to earn my living as an artist,&rdquo; Miss Price
answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then it is my duty to tell you that you are wasting your time. It would
not matter that you have no talent, talent does not run about the streets in
these days, but you have not the beginning of an aptitude. How long have you
been here? A child of five after two lessons would draw better than you do. I
only say one thing to you, give up this hopeless attempt. You&rsquo;re more
likely to earn your living as a bonne a tout faire than as a painter.
Look.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He seized a piece of charcoal, and it broke as he applied it to the paper. He
cursed, and with the stump drew great firm lines. He drew rapidly and spoke at
the same time, spitting out the words with venom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look, those arms are not the same length. That knee, it&rsquo;s
grotesque. I tell you a child of five. You see, she&rsquo;s not standing on her
legs. That foot!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With each word the angry pencil made a mark, and in a moment the drawing upon
which Fanny Price had spent so much time and eager trouble was unrecognisable,
a confusion of lines and smudges. At last he flung down the charcoal and stood
up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take my advice, Mademoiselle, try dressmaking.&rdquo; He looked at his
watch. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s twelve. A la semaine prochaine, messieurs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Price gathered up her things slowly. Philip waited behind after the others
to say to her something consolatory. He could think of nothing but:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, I&rsquo;m awfully sorry. What a beast that man is!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She turned on him savagely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that what you&rsquo;re waiting about for? When I want your sympathy
I&rsquo;ll ask for it. Please get out of my way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She walked past him, out of the studio, and Philip, with a shrug of the
shoulders, limped along to Gravier&rsquo;s for luncheon.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It served her right,&rdquo; said Lawson, when Philip told him what had
happened. &ldquo;Ill-tempered slut.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lawson was very sensitive to criticism and, in order to avoid it, never went to
the studio when Foinet was coming.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want other people&rsquo;s opinion of my work,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I know myself if it&rsquo;s good or bad.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mean you don&rsquo;t want other people&rsquo;s bad opinion of your
work,&rdquo; answered Clutton dryly.
</p>

<p>
In the afternoon Philip thought he would go to the Luxembourg to see the
pictures, and walking through the garden he saw Fanny Price sitting in her
accustomed seat. He was sore at the rudeness with which she had met his
well-meant attempt to say something pleasant, and passed as though he had not
caught sight of her. But she got up at once and came towards him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you trying to cut me?&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, of course not. I thought perhaps you didn&rsquo;t want to be spoken
to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wanted to have a look at the Manet, I&rsquo;ve heard so much about
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would you like me to come with you? I know the Luxembourg rather well. I
could show you one or two good things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He understood that, unable to bring herself to apologise directly, she made
this offer as amends.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully kind of you. I should like it very much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t say yes if you&rsquo;d rather go alone,&rdquo; she
said suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They walked towards the gallery. Caillebotte&rsquo;s collection had lately been
placed on view, and the student for the first time had the opportunity to
examine at his ease the works of the impressionists. Till then it had been
possible to see them only at Durand-Ruel&rsquo;s shop in the Rue Lafitte (and
the dealer, unlike his fellows in England, who adopt towards the painter an
attitude of superiority, was always pleased to show the shabbiest student
whatever he wanted to see), or at his private house, to which it was not
difficult to get a card of admission on Tuesdays, and where you might see
pictures of world-wide reputation. Miss Price led Philip straight up to
Manet&rsquo;s Olympia. He looked at it in astonished silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo; asked Miss Price.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered helplessly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can take it from me that it&rsquo;s the best thing in the gallery
except perhaps Whistler&rsquo;s portrait of his mother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She gave him a certain time to contemplate the masterpiece and then took him to
a picture representing a railway-station.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look, here&rsquo;s a Monet,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Gare
St. Lazare.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But the railway lines aren&rsquo;t parallel,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What does that matter?&rdquo; she asked, with a haughty air.
</p>

<p>
Philip felt ashamed of himself. Fanny Price had picked up the glib chatter of
the studios and had no difficulty in impressing Philip with the extent of her
knowledge. She proceeded to explain the pictures to him, superciliously but not
without insight, and showed him what the painters had attempted and what he
must look for. She talked with much gesticulation of the thumb, and Philip, to
whom all she said was new, listened with profound but bewildered interest. Till
now he had worshipped Watts and Burne-Jones. The pretty colour of the first,
the affected drawing of the second, had entirely satisfied his aesthetic
sensibilities. Their vague idealism, the suspicion of a philosophical idea
which underlay the titles they gave their pictures, accorded very well with the
functions of art as from his diligent perusal of Ruskin he understood it; but
here was something quite different: here was no moral appeal; and the
contemplation of these works could help no one to lead a purer and a higher
life. He was puzzled.
</p>

<p>
At last he said: &ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;m simply dead. I don&rsquo;t think I
can absorb anything more profitably. Let&rsquo;s go and sit down on one of the
benches.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better not to take too much art at a time,&rdquo; Miss Price
answered.
</p>

<p>
When they got outside he thanked her warmly for the trouble she had taken.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; she said, a little ungraciously.
&ldquo;I do it because I enjoy it. We&rsquo;ll go to the Louvre tomorrow if you
like, and then I&rsquo;ll take you to Durand-Ruel&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really awfully good to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think me such a beast as the most of them do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They think they&rsquo;ll drive me away from the studio; but they
won&rsquo;t; I shall stay there just exactly as long as it suits me. All that
this morning, it was Lucy Otter&rsquo;s doing, I know it was. She always has
hated me. She thought after that I&rsquo;d take myself off. I daresay
she&rsquo;d like me to go. She&rsquo;s afraid I know too much about her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Price told him a long, involved story, which made out that Mrs. Otter, a
humdrum and respectable little person, had scabrous intrigues. Then she talked
of Ruth Chalice, the girl whom Foinet had praised that morning.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been with every one of the fellows at the studio.
She&rsquo;s nothing better than a street-walker. And she&rsquo;s dirty. She
hasn&rsquo;t had a bath for a month. I know it for a fact.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip listened uncomfortably. He had heard already that various rumours were
in circulation about Miss Chalice; but it was ridiculous to suppose that Mrs.
Otter, living with her mother, was anything but rigidly virtuous. The woman
walking by his side with her malignant lying positively horrified him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what they say. I shall go on just the same. I know
I&rsquo;ve got it in me. I feel I&rsquo;m an artist. I&rsquo;d sooner kill
myself than give it up. Oh, I shan&rsquo;t be the first they&rsquo;ve all
laughed at in the schools and then he&rsquo;s turned out the only genius of the
lot. Art&rsquo;s the only thing I care for, I&rsquo;m willing to give my whole
life to it. It&rsquo;s only a question of sticking to it and pegging
away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She found discreditable motives for everyone who would not take her at her own
estimate of herself. She detested Clutton. She told Philip that his friend had
no talent really; it was just flashy and superficial; he couldn&rsquo;t compose
a figure to save his life. And Lawson:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Little beast, with his red hair and his freckles. He&rsquo;s so afraid
of Foinet that he won&rsquo;t let him see his work. After all, I don&rsquo;t
funk it, do I? I don&rsquo;t care what Foinet says to me, I know I&rsquo;m a
real artist.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They reached the street in which she lived, and with a sigh of relief Philip
left her.
</p>

<h2>XLIV</h2>

<p>
But notwithstanding when Miss Price on the following Sunday offered to take him
to the Louvre Philip accepted. She showed him Mona Lisa. He looked at it with a
slight feeling of disappointment, but he had read till he knew by heart the
jewelled words with which Walter Pater has added beauty to the most famous
picture in the world; and these now he repeated to Miss Price.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all literature,&rdquo; she said, a little contemptuously.
&ldquo;You must get away from that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She showed him the Rembrandts, and she said many appropriate things about them.
She stood in front of the Disciples at Emmaus.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When you feel the beauty of that,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
know something about painting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She showed him the Odalisque and La Source of Ingres. Fanny Price was a
peremptory guide, she would not let him look at the things he wished, and
attempted to force his admiration for all she admired. She was desperately in
earnest with her study of art, and when Philip, passing in the Long Gallery a
window that looked out on the Tuileries, gay, sunny, and urbane, like a picture
by Raffaelli, exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, how jolly! Do let&rsquo;s stop here a minute.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She said, indifferently: &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s all right. But we&rsquo;ve come
here to look at pictures.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The autumn air, blithe and vivacious, elated Philip; and when towards mid-day
they stood in the great court-yard of the Louvre, he felt inclined to cry like
Flanagan: To hell with art.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, do let&rsquo;s go to one of those restaurants in the Boul&rsquo;
Mich&rsquo; and have a snack together, shall we?&rdquo; he suggested.
</p>

<p>
Miss Price gave him a suspicious look.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my lunch waiting for me at home,&rdquo; she answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter. You can eat it tomorrow. Do let me stand you
a lunch.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you want to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It would give me pleasure,&rdquo; he replied, smiling.
</p>

<p>
They crossed the river, and at the corner of the Boulevard St. Michel there was
a restaurant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go in there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t go there, it looks too expensive.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She walked on firmly, and Philip was obliged to follow. A few steps brought
them to a smaller restaurant, where a dozen people were already lunching on the
pavement under an awning; on the window was announced in large white letters:
Dejeuner 1.25, vin compris.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t have anything cheaper than this, and it looks quite
all right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They sat down at a vacant table and waited for the omelette which was the first
article on the bill of fare. Philip gazed with delight upon the passers-by. His
heart went out to them. He was tired but very happy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, look at that man in the blouse. Isn&rsquo;t he ripping!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He glanced at Miss Price, and to his astonishment saw that she was looking down
at her plate, regardless of the passing spectacle, and two heavy tears were
rolling down her cheeks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What on earth&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you say anything to me I shall get up and go at once,&rdquo; she
answered.
</p>

<p>
He was entirely puzzled, but fortunately at that moment the omelette came. He
divided it in two and they began to eat. Philip did his best to talk of
indifferent things, and it seemed as though Miss Price were making an effort on
her side to be agreeable; but the luncheon was not altogether a success. Philip
was squeamish, and the way in which Miss Price ate took his appetite away. She
ate noisily, greedily, a little like a wild beast in a menagerie, and after she
had finished each course rubbed the plate with pieces of bread till it was
white and shining, as if she did not wish to lose a single drop of gravy. They
had Camembert cheese, and it disgusted Philip to see that she ate rind and all
of the portion that was given her. She could not have eaten more ravenously if
she were starving.
</p>

<p>
Miss Price was unaccountable, and having parted from her on one day with
friendliness he could never tell whether on the next she would not be sulky and
uncivil; but he learned a good deal from her: though she could not draw well
herself, she knew all that could be taught, and her constant suggestions helped
his progress. Mrs. Otter was useful to him too, and sometimes Miss Chalice
criticised his work; he learned from the glib loquacity of Lawson and from the
example of Clutton. But Fanny Price hated him to take suggestions from anyone
but herself, and when he asked her help after someone else had been talking to
him she would refuse with brutal rudeness. The other fellows, Lawson, Clutton,
Flanagan, chaffed him about her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You be careful, my lad,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s in love
with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, what nonsense,&rdquo; he laughed.
</p>

<p>
The thought that Miss Price could be in love with anyone was preposterous. It
made him shudder when he thought of her uncomeliness, the bedraggled hair and
the dirty hands, the brown dress she always wore, stained and ragged at the
hem: he supposed she was hard up, they were all hard up, but she might at least
be clean; and it was surely possible with a needle and thread to make her skirt
tidy.
</p>

<p>
Philip began to sort his impressions of the people he was thrown in contact
with. He was not so ingenuous as in those days which now seemed so long ago at
Heidelberg, and, beginning to take a more deliberate interest in humanity, he
was inclined to examine and to criticise. He found it difficult to know Clutton
any better after seeing him every day for three months than on the first day of
their acquaintance. The general impression at the studio was that he was able;
it was supposed that he would do great things, and he shared the general
opinion; but what exactly he was going to do neither he nor anybody else quite
knew. He had worked at several studios before Amitrano&rsquo;s, at
Julian&rsquo;s, the Beaux Arts, and MacPherson&rsquo;s, and was remaining
longer at Amitrano&rsquo;s than anywhere because he found himself more left
alone. He was not fond of showing his work, and unlike most of the young men
who were studying art neither sought nor gave advice. It was said that in the
little studio in the Rue Campagne Premiere, which served him for work-room and
bed-room, he had wonderful pictures which would make his reputation if only he
could be induced to exhibit them. He could not afford a model but painted still
life, and Lawson constantly talked of a plate of apples which he declared was a
masterpiece. He was fastidious, and, aiming at something he did not quite fully
grasp, was constantly dissatisfied with his work as a whole: perhaps a part
would please him, the forearm or the leg and foot of a figure, a glass or a cup
in a still-life; and he would cut this out and keep it, destroying the rest of
the canvas; so that when people invited themselves to see his work he could
truthfully answer that he had not a single picture to show. In Brittany he had
come across a painter whom nobody else had heard of, a queer fellow who had
been a stockbroker and taken up painting at middle-age, and he was greatly
influenced by his work. He was turning his back on the impressionists and
working out for himself painfully an individual way not only of painting but of
seeing. Philip felt in him something strangely original.
</p>

<p>
At Gravier&rsquo;s where they ate, and in the evening at the Versailles or at
the Closerie des Lilas Clutton was inclined to taciturnity. He sat quietly,
with a sardonic expression on his gaunt face, and spoke only when the
opportunity occurred to throw in a witticism. He liked a butt and was most
cheerful when someone was there on whom he could exercise his sarcasm. He
seldom talked of anything but painting, and then only with the one or two
persons whom he thought worth while. Philip wondered whether there was in him
really anything: his reticence, the haggard look of him, the pungent humour,
seemed to suggest personality, but might be no more than an effective mask
which covered nothing.
</p>

<p>
With Lawson on the other hand Philip soon grew intimate. He had a variety of
interests which made him an agreeable companion. He read more than most of the
students and though his income was small, loved to buy books. He lent them
willingly; and Philip became acquainted with Flaubert and Balzac, with
Verlaine, Heredia, and Villiers de l&rsquo;Isle Adam. They went to plays
together and sometimes to the gallery of the Opera Comique. There was the Odeon
quite near them, and Philip soon shared his friend&rsquo;s passion for the
tragedians of Louis XIV and the sonorous Alexandrine. In the Rue Taitbout were
the Concerts Rouge, where for seventy-five centimes they could hear excellent
music and get into the bargain something which it was quite possible to drink:
the seats were uncomfortable, the place was crowded, the air thick with caporal
horrible to breathe, but in their young enthusiasm they were indifferent.
Sometimes they went to the Bal Bullier. On these occasions Flanagan accompanied
them. His excitability and his roisterous enthusiasm made them laugh. He was an
excellent dancer, and before they had been ten minutes in the room he was
prancing round with some little shop-girl whose acquaintance he had just made.
</p>

<p>
The desire of all of them was to have a mistress. It was part of the
paraphernalia of the art-student in Paris. It gave consideration in the eyes of
one&rsquo;s fellows. It was something to boast about. But the difficulty was
that they had scarcely enough money to keep themselves, and though they argued
that French-women were so clever it cost no more to keep two then one, they
found it difficult to meet young women who were willing to take that view of
the circumstances. They had to content themselves for the most part with
envying and abusing the ladies who received protection from painters of more
settled respectability than their own. It was extraordinary how difficult these
things were in Paris. Lawson would become acquainted with some young thing and
make an appointment; for twenty-four hours he would be all in a flutter and
describe the charmer at length to everyone he met; but she never by any chance
turned up at the time fixed. He would come to Gravier&rsquo;s very late,
ill-tempered, and exclaim:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Confound it, another rabbit! I don&rsquo;t know why it is they
don&rsquo;t like me. I suppose it&rsquo;s because I don&rsquo;t speak French
well, or my red hair. It&rsquo;s too sickening to have spent over a year in
Paris without getting hold of anyone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t go the right way to work,&rdquo; said Flanagan.
</p>

<p>
He had a long and enviable list of triumphs to narrate, and though they took
leave not to believe all he said, evidence forced them to acknowledge that he
did not altogether lie. But he sought no permanent arrangement. He only had two
years in Paris: he had persuaded his people to let him come and study art
instead of going to college; but at the end of that period he was to return to
Seattle and go into his father&rsquo;s business. He had made up his mind to get
as much fun as possible into the time, and demanded variety rather than
duration in his love affairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you get hold of them,&rdquo; said Lawson
furiously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no difficulty about that, sonny,&rdquo; answered Flanagan.
&ldquo;You just go right in. The difficulty is to get rid of them. That&rsquo;s
where you want tact.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was too much occupied with his work, the books he was reading, the plays
he saw, the conversation he listened to, to trouble himself with the desire for
female society. He thought there would be plenty of time for that when he could
speak French more glibly.
</p>

<p>
It was more than a year now since he had seen Miss Wilkinson, and during his
first weeks in Paris he had been too busy to answer a letter she had written to
him just before he left Blackstable. When another came, knowing it would be
full of reproaches and not being just then in the mood for them, he put it
aside, intending to open it later; but he forgot and did not run across it till
a month afterwards, when he was turning out a drawer to find some socks that
had no holes in them. He looked at the unopened letter with dismay. He was
afraid that Miss Wilkinson had suffered a good deal, and it made him feel a
brute; but she had probably got over the suffering by now, at all events the
worst of it. It suggested itself to him that women were often very emphatic in
their expressions. These did not mean so much as when men used them. He had
quite made up his mind that nothing would induce him ever to see her again. He
had not written for so long that it seemed hardly worth while to write now. He
made up his mind not to read the letter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I daresay she won&rsquo;t write again,&rdquo; he said to himself.
&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t help seeing the thing&rsquo;s over. After all, she was
old enough to be my mother; she ought to have known better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
For an hour or two he felt a little uncomfortable. His attitude was obviously
the right one, but he could not help a feeling of dissatisfaction with the
whole business. Miss Wilkinson, however, did not write again; nor did she, as
he absurdly feared, suddenly appear in Paris to make him ridiculous before his
friends. In a little while he clean forgot her.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile he definitely forsook his old gods. The amazement with which at first
he had looked upon the works of the impressionists, changed to admiration; and
presently he found himself talking as emphatically as the rest on the merits of
Manet, Monet, and Degas. He bought a photograph of a drawing by Ingres of the
Odalisque and a photograph of the Olympia. They were pinned side by side over
his washing-stand so that he could contemplate their beauty while he shaved. He
knew now quite positively that there had been no painting of landscape before
Monet; and he felt a real thrill when he stood in front of Rembrandt&rsquo;s
Disciples at Emmaus or Velasquez&rsquo; Lady with the Flea-bitten Nose. That
was not her real name, but by that she was distinguished at Gravier&rsquo;s to
emphasise the picture&rsquo;s beauty notwithstanding the somewhat revolting
peculiarity of the sitter&rsquo;s appearance. With Ruskin, Burne-Jones, and
Watts, he had put aside his bowler hat and the neat blue tie with white spots
which he had worn on coming to Paris; and now disported himself in a soft,
broad-brimmed hat, a flowing black cravat, and a cape of romantic cut. He
walked along the Boulevard du Montparnasse as though he had known it all his
life, and by virtuous perseverance he had learnt to drink absinthe without
distaste. He was letting his hair grow, and it was only because Nature is
unkind and has no regard for the immortal longings of youth that he did not
attempt a beard.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>XLV</h2>

<p>
Philip soon realised that the spirit which informed his friends was
Cronshaw&rsquo;s. It was from him that Lawson got his paradoxes; and even
Clutton, who strained after individuality, expressed himself in the terms he
had insensibly acquired from the older man. It was his ideas that they bandied
about at table, and on his authority they formed their judgments. They made up
for the respect with which unconsciously they treated him by laughing at his
foibles and lamenting his vices.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course, poor old Cronshaw will never do any good,&rdquo; they said.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s quite hopeless.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They prided themselves on being alone in appreciating his genius; and though,
with the contempt of youth for the follies of middle-age, they patronised him
among themselves, they did not fail to look upon it as a feather in their caps
if he had chosen a time when only one was there to be particularly wonderful.
Cronshaw never came to Gravier&rsquo;s. For the last four years he had lived in
squalid conditions with a woman whom only Lawson had once seen, in a tiny
apartment on the sixth floor of one of the most dilapidated houses on the Quai
des Grands Augustins: Lawson described with gusto the filth, the untidiness,
the litter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And the stink nearly blew your head off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not at dinner, Lawson,&rdquo; expostulated one of the others.
</p>

<p>
But he would not deny himself the pleasure of giving picturesque details of the
odours which met his nostril. With a fierce delight in his own realism he
described the woman who had opened the door for him. She was dark, small, and
fat, quite young, with black hair that seemed always on the point of coming
down. She wore a slatternly blouse and no corsets. With her red cheeks, large
sensual mouth, and shining, lewd eyes, she reminded you of the Bohemienne in
the Louvre by Franz Hals. She had a flaunting vulgarity which amused and yet
horrified. A scrubby, unwashed baby was playing on the floor. It was known that
the slut deceived Cronshaw with the most worthless ragamuffins of the Quarter,
and it was a mystery to the ingenuous youths who absorbed his wisdom over a
cafe table that Cronshaw with his keen intellect and his passion for beauty
could ally himself to such a creature. But he seemed to revel in the coarseness
of her language and would often report some phrase which reeked of the gutter.
He referred to her ironically as la fille de mon concierge. Cronshaw was very
poor. He earned a bare subsistence by writing on the exhibitions of pictures
for one or two English papers, and he did a certain amount of translating. He
had been on the staff of an English paper in Paris, but had been dismissed for
drunkenness; he still however did odd jobs for it, describing sales at the
Hotel Drouot or the revues at music-halls. The life of Paris had got into his
bones, and he would not change it, notwithstanding its squalor, drudgery, and
hardship, for any other in the world. He remained there all through the year,
even in summer when everyone he knew was away, and felt himself only at ease
within a mile of the Boulevard St. Michel. But the curious thing was that he
had never learnt to speak French passably, and he kept in his shabby clothes
bought at La Belle Jardiniere an ineradicably English appearance.
</p>

<p>
He was a man who would have made a success of life a century and a half ago
when conversation was a passport to good company and inebriety no bar.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I ought to have lived in the eighteen hundreds,&rdquo; he said himself.
&ldquo;What I want is a patron. I should have published my poems by
subscription and dedicated them to a nobleman. I long to compose rhymed
couplets upon the poodle of a countess. My soul yearns for the love of
chamber-maids and the conversation of bishops.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He quoted the romantic Rolla,
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Je suis venu trop tard dans un monde trop vieux.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He liked new faces, and he took a fancy to Philip, who seemed to achieve the
difficult feat of talking just enough to suggest conversation and not too much
to prevent monologue. Philip was captivated. He did not realise that little
that Cronshaw said was new. His personality in conversation had a curious
power. He had a beautiful and a sonorous voice, and a manner of putting things
which was irresistible to youth. All he said seemed to excite thought, and
often on the way home Lawson and Philip would walk to and from one
another&rsquo;s hotels, discussing some point which a chance word of Cronshaw
had suggested. It was disconcerting to Philip, who had a youthful eagerness for
results, that Cronshaw&rsquo;s poetry hardly came up to expectation. It had
never been published in a volume, but most of it had appeared in periodicals;
and after a good deal of persuasion Cronshaw brought down a bundle of pages
torn out of The Yellow Book, The Saturday Review, and other journals, on each
of which was a poem. Philip was taken aback to find that most of them reminded
him either of Henley or of Swinburne. It needed the splendour of
Cronshaw&rsquo;s delivery to make them personal. He expressed his
disappointment to Lawson, who carelessly repeated his words; and next time
Philip went to the Closerie des Lilas the poet turned to him with his sleek
smile:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hear you don&rsquo;t think much of my verses.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was embarrassed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I enjoyed
reading them very much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do not attempt to spare my feelings,&rdquo; returned Cronshaw, with a
wave of his fat hand. &ldquo;I do not attach any exaggerated importance to my
poetical works. Life is there to be lived rather than to be written about. My
aim is to search out the manifold experience that it offers, wringing from each
moment what of emotion it presents. I look upon my writing as a graceful
accomplishment which does not absorb but rather adds pleasure to existence. And
as for posterity&mdash;damn posterity.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip smiled, for it leaped to one&rsquo;s eyes that the artist in life had
produced no more than a wretched daub. Cronshaw looked at him meditatively and
filled his glass. He sent the waiter for a packet of cigarettes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are amused because I talk in this fashion and you know that I am
poor and live in an attic with a vulgar trollop who deceives me with
hair-dressers and garcons de cafe; I translate wretched books for the British
public, and write articles upon contemptible pictures which deserve not even to
be abused. But pray tell me what is the meaning of life?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, that&rsquo;s rather a difficult question. Won&rsquo;t you give
the answer yourself?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, because it&rsquo;s worthless unless you yourself discover it. But
what do you suppose you are in the world for?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip had never asked himself, and he thought for a moment before replying.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know: I suppose to do one&rsquo;s duty, and make the
best possible use of one&rsquo;s faculties, and avoid hurting other
people.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In short, to do unto others as you would they should do unto you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Christianity.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Philip indignantly. &ldquo;It has
nothing to do with Christianity. It&rsquo;s just abstract morality.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no such thing as abstract morality.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In that case, supposing under the influence of liquor you left your
purse behind when you leave here and I picked it up, why do you imagine that I
should return it to you? It&rsquo;s not the fear of the police.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the dread of hell if you sin and the hope of Heaven if you
are virtuous.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I believe in neither.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That may be. Neither did Kant when he devised the Categorical
Imperative. You have thrown aside a creed, but you have preserved the ethic
which was based upon it. To all intents you are a Christian still, and if there
is a God in Heaven you will undoubtedly receive your reward. The Almighty can
hardly be such a fool as the churches make out. If you keep His laws I
don&rsquo;t think He can care a packet of pins whether you believe in Him or
not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But if I left my purse behind you would certainly return it to
me,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not from motives of abstract morality, but only from fear of the
police.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a thousand to one that the police would never find
out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My ancestors have lived in a civilised state so long that the fear of
the police has eaten into my bones. The daughter of my concierge would not
hesitate for a moment. You answer that she belongs to the criminal classes; not
at all, she is merely devoid of vulgar prejudice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But then that does away with honour and virtue and goodness and decency
and everything,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you ever committed a sin?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I suppose so,&rdquo; answered Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You speak with the lips of a dissenting minister. I have never committed
a sin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Cronshaw in his shabby great-coat, with the collar turned up, and his hat well
down on his head, with his red fat face and his little gleaming eyes, looked
extraordinarily comic; but Philip was too much in earnest to laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you never done anything you regret?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can I regret when what I did was inevitable?&rdquo; asked Cronshaw
in return.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s fatalism.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The illusion which man has that his will is free is so deeply rooted
that I am ready to accept it. I act as though I were a free agent. But when an
action is performed it is clear that all the forces of the universe from all
eternity conspired to cause it, and nothing I could do could have prevented it.
It was inevitable. If it was good I can claim no merit; if it was bad I can
accept no censure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My brain reels,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have some whiskey,&rdquo; returned Cronshaw, passing over the bottle.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like it for clearing the head. You must expect to
be thick-witted if you insist upon drinking beer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip shook his head, and Cronshaw proceeded:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a bad fellow, but you won&rsquo;t drink. Sobriety
disturbs conversation. But when I speak of good and bad…&rdquo; Philip saw he
was taking up the thread of his discourse, &ldquo;I speak conventionally. I
attach no meaning to those words. I refuse to make a hierarchy of human actions
and ascribe worthiness to some and ill-repute to others. The terms vice and
virtue have no signification for me. I do not confer praise or blame: I accept.
I am the measure of all things. I am the centre of the world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But there are one or two other people in the world,&rdquo; objected
Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I speak only for myself. I know them only as they limit my activities.
Round each of them too the world turns, and each one for himself is the centre
of the universe. My right over them extends only as far as my power. What I can
do is the only limit of what I may do. Because we are gregarious we live in
society, and society holds together by means of force, force of arms (that is
the policeman) and force of public opinion (that is Mrs. Grundy). You have
society on one hand and the individual on the other: each is an organism
striving for self-preservation. It is might against might. I stand alone, bound
to accept society and not unwilling, since in return for the taxes I pay it
protects me, a weakling, against the tyranny of another stronger than I am; but
I submit to its laws because I must; I do not acknowledge their justice: I do
not know justice, I only know power. And when I have paid for the policeman who
protects me and, if I live in a country where conscription is in force, served
in the army which guards my house and land from the invader, I am quits with
society: for the rest I counter its might with my wiliness. It makes laws for
its self-preservation, and if I break them it imprisons or kills me: it has the
might to do so and therefore the right. If I break the laws I will accept the
vengeance of the state, but I will not regard it as punishment nor shall I feel
myself convicted of wrong-doing. Society tempts me to its service by honours
and riches and the good opinion of my fellows; but I am indifferent to their
good opinion, I despise honours and I can do very well without riches.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But if everyone thought like you things would go to pieces at
once.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have nothing to do with others, I am only concerned with myself. I
take advantage of the fact that the majority of mankind are led by certain
rewards to do things which directly or indirectly tend to my
convenience.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It seems to me an awfully selfish way of looking at things,&rdquo; said
Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But are you under the impression that men ever do anything except for
selfish reasons?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is impossible that they should. You will find as you grow older that
the first thing needful to make the world a tolerable place to live in is to
recognise the inevitable selfishness of humanity. You demand unselfishness from
others, which is a preposterous claim that they should sacrifice their desires
to yours. Why should they? When you are reconciled to the fact that each is for
himself in the world you will ask less from your fellows. They will not
disappoint you, and you will look upon them more charitably. Men seek but one
thing in life&mdash;their pleasure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; cried Philip.
</p>

<p>
Cronshaw chuckled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You rear like a frightened colt, because I use a word to which your
Christianity ascribes a deprecatory meaning. You have a hierarchy of values;
pleasure is at the bottom of the ladder, and you speak with a little thrill of
self-satisfaction, of duty, charity, and truthfulness. You think pleasure is
only of the senses; the wretched slaves who manufactured your morality despised
a satisfaction which they had small means of enjoying. You would not be so
frightened if I had spoken of happiness instead of pleasure: it sounds less
shocking, and your mind wanders from the sty of Epicurus to his garden. But I
will speak of pleasure, for I see that men aim at that, and I do not know that
they aim at happiness. It is pleasure that lurks in the practice of every one
of your virtues. Man performs actions because they are good for him, and when
they are good for other people as well they are thought virtuous: if he finds
pleasure in giving alms he is charitable; if he finds pleasure in helping
others he is benevolent; if he finds pleasure in working for society he is
public-spirited; but it is for your private pleasure that you give twopence to
a beggar as much as it is for my private pleasure that I drink another whiskey
and soda. I, less of a humbug than you, neither applaud myself for my pleasure
nor demand your admiration.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But have you never known people do things they didn&rsquo;t want to
instead of things they did?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. You put your question foolishly. What you mean is that people accept
an immediate pain rather than an immediate pleasure. The objection is as
foolish as your manner of putting it. It is clear that men accept an immediate
pain rather than an immediate pleasure, but only because they expect a greater
pleasure in the future. Often the pleasure is illusory, but their error in
calculation is no refutation of the rule. You are puzzled because you cannot
get over the idea that pleasures are only of the senses; but, child, a man who
dies for his country dies because he likes it as surely as a man eats pickled
cabbage because he likes it. It is a law of creation. If it were possible for
men to prefer pain to pleasure the human race would have long since become
extinct.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But if all that is true,&rdquo; cried Philip, &ldquo;what is the use of
anything? If you take away duty and goodness and beauty why are we brought into
the world?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here comes the gorgeous East to suggest an answer,&rdquo; smiled
Cronshaw.
</p>

<p>
He pointed to two persons who at that moment opened the door of the cafe, and,
with a blast of cold air, entered. They were Levantines, itinerant vendors of
cheap rugs, and each bore on his arm a bundle. It was Sunday evening, and the
cafe was very full. They passed among the tables, and in that atmosphere heavy
and discoloured with tobacco smoke, rank with humanity, they seemed to bring an
air of mystery. They were clad in European, shabby clothes, their thin
great-coats were threadbare, but each wore a tarbouch. Their faces were gray
with cold. One was of middle age, with a black beard, but the other was a youth
of eighteen, with a face deeply scarred by smallpox and with one eye only. They
passed by Cronshaw and Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Allah is great, and Mahomet is his prophet,&rdquo; said Cronshaw
impressively.
</p>

<p>
The elder advanced with a cringing smile, like a mongrel used to blows. With a
sidelong glance at the door and a quick surreptitious movement he showed a
pornographic picture.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you Masr-ed-Deen, the merchant of Alexandria, or is it from far
Bagdad that you bring your goods, O, my uncle; and yonder one-eyed youth, do I
see in him one of the three kings of whom Scheherazade told stories to her
lord?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The pedlar&rsquo;s smile grew more ingratiating, though he understood no word
of what Cronshaw said, and like a conjurer he produced a sandalwood box.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nay, show us the priceless web of Eastern looms,&rdquo; quoth Cronshaw.
&ldquo;For I would point a moral and adorn a tale.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Levantine unfolded a table-cloth, red and yellow, vulgar, hideous, and
grotesque.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thirty-five francs,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, my uncle, this cloth knew not the weavers of Samarkand, and those
colours were never made in the vats of Bokhara.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Twenty-five francs,&rdquo; smiled the pedlar obsequiously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ultima Thule was the place of its manufacture, even Birmingham the place
of my birth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fifteen francs,&rdquo; cringed the bearded man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Get thee gone, fellow,&rdquo; said Cronshaw. &ldquo;May wild asses
defile the grave of thy maternal grandmother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Imperturbably, but smiling no more, the Levantine passed with his wares to
another table. Cronshaw turned to Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you ever been to the Cluny, the museum? There you will see Persian
carpets of the most exquisite hue and of a pattern the beautiful intricacy of
which delights and amazes the eye. In them you will see the mystery and the
sensual beauty of the East, the roses of Hafiz and the wine-cup of Omar; but
presently you will see more. You were asking just now what was the meaning of
life. Go and look at those Persian carpets, and one of these days the answer
will come to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are cryptic,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am drunk,&rdquo; answered Cronshaw.
</p>

<h2>XLVI</h2>

<p>
Philip did not find living in Paris as cheap as he had been led to believe and
by February had spent most of the money with which he started. He was too proud
to appeal to his guardian, nor did he wish Aunt Louisa to know that his
circumstances were straitened, since he was certain she would make an effort to
send him something from her own pocket, and he knew how little she could afford
to. In three months he would attain his majority and come into possession of
his small fortune. He tided over the interval by selling the few trinkets which
he had inherited from his father.
</p>

<p>
At about this time Lawson suggested that they should take a small studio which
was vacant in one of the streets that led out of the Boulevard Raspail. It was
very cheap. It had a room attached, which they could use as a bed-room; and
since Philip was at the school every morning Lawson could have the undisturbed
use of the studio then; Lawson, after wandering from school to school, had come
to the conclusion that he could work best alone, and proposed to get a model in
three or four days a week. At first Philip hesitated on account of the expense,
but they reckoned it out; and it seemed (they were so anxious to have a studio
of their own that they calculated pragmatically) that the cost would not be
much greater than that of living in a hotel. Though the rent and the cleaning
by the concierge would come to a little more, they would save on the petit
dejeuner, which they could make themselves. A year or two earlier Philip would
have refused to share a room with anyone, since he was so sensitive about his
deformed foot, but his morbid way of looking at it was growing less marked: in
Paris it did not seem to matter so much, and, though he never by any chance
forgot it himself, he ceased to feel that other people were constantly noticing
it.
</p>

<p>
They moved in, bought a couple of beds, a washing-stand, a few chairs, and felt
for the first time the thrill of possession. They were so excited that the
first night they went to bed in what they could call a home they lay awake
talking till three in the morning; and next day found lighting the fire and
making their own coffee, which they had in pyjamas, such a jolly business that
Philip did not get to Amitrano&rsquo;s till nearly eleven. He was in excellent
spirits. He nodded to Fanny Price.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How are you getting on?&rdquo; he asked cheerily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What does that matter to you?&rdquo; she asked in reply.
</p>

<p>
Philip could not help laughing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t jump down my throat. I was only trying to make myself
polite.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want your politeness.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you think it&rsquo;s worth while quarrelling with me too?&rdquo;
asked Philip mildly. &ldquo;There are so few people you&rsquo;re on speaking
terms with, as it is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my business, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He began to work, vaguely wondering why Fanny Price made herself so
disagreeable. He had come to the conclusion that he thoroughly disliked her.
Everyone did. People were only civil to her at all from fear of the malice of
her tongue; for to their faces and behind their backs she said abominable
things. But Philip was feeling so happy that he did not want even Miss Price to
bear ill-feeling towards him. He used the artifice which had often before
succeeded in banishing her ill-humour.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, I wish you&rsquo;d come and look at my drawing. I&rsquo;ve got in
an awful mess.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you very much, but I&rsquo;ve got something better to do with my
time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip stared at her in surprise, for the one thing she could be counted upon
to do with alacrity was to give advice. She went on quickly in a low voice,
savage with fury.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now that Lawson&rsquo;s gone you think you&rsquo;ll put up with me.
Thank you very much. Go and find somebody else to help you. I don&rsquo;t want
anybody else&rsquo;s leavings.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lawson had the pedagogic instinct; whenever he found anything out he was eager
to impart it; and because he taught with delight he talked with profit. Philip,
without thinking anything about it, had got into the habit of sitting by his
side; it never occurred to him that Fanny Price was consumed with jealousy, and
watched his acceptance of someone else&rsquo;s tuition with ever-increasing
anger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You were very glad to put up with me when you knew nobody here,&rdquo;
she said bitterly, &ldquo;and as soon as you made friends with other people you
threw me aside, like an old glove&rdquo;&mdash;she repeated the stale metaphor
with satisfaction&mdash;&ldquo;like an old glove. All right, I don&rsquo;t
care, but I&rsquo;m not going to be made a fool of another time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a suspicion of truth in what she said, and it made Philip angry
enough to answer what first came into his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hang it all, I only asked your advice because I saw it pleased
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She gave a gasp and threw him a sudden look of anguish. Then two tears rolled
down her cheeks. She looked frowsy and grotesque. Philip, not knowing what on
earth this new attitude implied, went back to his work. He was uneasy and
conscience-stricken; but he would not go to her and say he was sorry if he had
caused her pain, because he was afraid she would take the opportunity to snub
him. For two or three weeks she did not speak to him, and, after Philip had got
over the discomfort of being cut by her, he was somewhat relieved to be free
from so difficult a friendship. He had been a little disconcerted by the air of
proprietorship she assumed over him. She was an extraordinary woman. She came
every day to the studio at eight o&rsquo;clock, and was ready to start working
when the model was in position; she worked steadily, talking to no one,
struggling hour after hour with difficulties she could not overcome, and
remained till the clock struck twelve. Her work was hopeless. There was not in
it the smallest approach even to the mediocre achievement at which most of the
young persons were able after some months to arrive. She wore every day the
same ugly brown dress, with the mud of the last wet day still caked on the hem
and with the raggedness, which Philip had noticed the first time he saw her,
still unmended.
</p>

<p>
But one day she came up to him, and with a scarlet face asked whether she might
speak to him afterwards.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course, as much as you like,&rdquo; smiled Philip. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
wait behind at twelve.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He went to her when the day&rsquo;s work was over.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you walk a little bit with me?&rdquo; she said, looking away from
him with embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They walked for two or three minutes in silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you remember what you said to me the other day?&rdquo; she asked
then on a sudden.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I say, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s quarrel,&rdquo; said Philip.
&ldquo;It really isn&rsquo;t worth while.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She gave a quick, painful inspiration.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to quarrel with you. You&rsquo;re the only friend I
had in Paris. I thought you rather liked me. I felt there was something between
us. I was drawn towards you&mdash;you know what I mean, your club-foot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip reddened and instinctively tried to walk without a limp. He did not like
anyone to mention the deformity. He knew what Fanny Price meant. She was ugly
and uncouth, and because he was deformed there was between them a certain
sympathy. He was very angry with her, but he forced himself not to speak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You said you only asked my advice to please me. Don&rsquo;t you think my
work&rsquo;s any good?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only seen your drawing at Amitrano&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s
awfully hard to judge from that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was wondering if you&rsquo;d come and look at my other work.
I&rsquo;ve never asked anyone else to look at it. I should like to show it to
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully kind of you. I&rsquo;d like to see it very
much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I live quite near here,&rdquo; she said apologetically.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll only take you ten minutes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
They were walking along the boulevard, and she turned down a side street, then
led him into another, poorer still, with cheap shops on the ground floor, and
at last stopped. They climbed flight after flight of stairs. She unlocked a
door, and they went into a tiny attic with a sloping roof and a small window.
This was closed and the room had a musty smell. Though it was very cold there
was no fire and no sign that there had been one. The bed was unmade. A chair, a
chest of drawers which served also as a wash-stand, and a cheap easel, were all
the furniture. The place would have been squalid enough in any case, but the
litter, the untidiness, made the impression revolting. On the chimney-piece,
scattered over with paints and brushes, were a cup, a dirty plate, and a
tea-pot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll stand over there I&rsquo;ll put them on the chair so
that you can see them better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She showed him twenty small canvases, about eighteen by twelve. She placed them
on the chair, one after the other, watching his face; he nodded as he looked at
each one.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You do like them, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she said anxiously, after a
bit.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I just want to look at them all first,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk afterwards.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was collecting himself. He was panic-stricken. He did not know what to say.
It was not only that they were ill-drawn, or that the colour was put on
amateurishly by someone who had no eye for it; but there was no attempt at
getting the values, and the perspective was grotesque. It looked like the work
of a child of five, but a child would have had some naivete and might at least
have made an attempt to put down what he saw; but here was the work of a vulgar
mind chock full of recollections of vulgar pictures. Philip remembered that she
had talked enthusiastically about Monet and the Impressionists, but here were
only the worst traditions of the Royal Academy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the lot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was no more truthful than anybody else, but he had a great difficulty in
telling a thundering, deliberate lie, and he blushed furiously when he
answered:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re most awfully good.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A faint colour came into her unhealthy cheeks, and she smiled a little.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t say so if you don&rsquo;t think so, you know. I want
the truth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I do think so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got any criticism to offer? There must be some you
don&rsquo;t like as well as others.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip looked round helplessly. He saw a landscape, the typical picturesque
&lsquo;bit&rsquo; of the amateur, an old bridge, a creeper-clad cottage, and a
leafy bank.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t pretend to know anything about it,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;But I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure about the values of that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She flushed darkly and taking up the picture quickly turned its back to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you should have chosen that one to sneer at.
It&rsquo;s the best thing I&rsquo;ve ever done. I&rsquo;m sure my values are
all right. That&rsquo;s a thing you can&rsquo;t teach anyone, you either
understand values or you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re all most awfully good,&rdquo; repeated Philip.
</p>

<p>
She looked at them with an air of self-satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re anything to be ashamed of.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip looked at his watch.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, it&rsquo;s getting late. Won&rsquo;t you let me give you a little
lunch?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my lunch waiting for me here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip saw no sign of it, but supposed perhaps the concierge would bring it up
when he was gone. He was in a hurry to get away. The mustiness of the room made
his head ache.

<h2>XLVII</h2>

<p>
In March there was all the excitement of sending in to the Salon. Clutton,
characteristically, had nothing ready, and he was very scornful of the two
heads that Lawson sent; they were obviously the work of a student,
straight-forward portraits of models, but they had a certain force; Clutton,
aiming at perfection, had no patience with efforts which betrayed hesitancy,
and with a shrug of the shoulders told Lawson it was an impertinence to exhibit
stuff which should never have been allowed out of his studio; he was not less
contemptuous when the two heads were accepted. Flanagan tried his luck too, but
his picture was refused. Mrs. Otter sent a blameless Portrait de ma Mere,
accomplished and second-rate; and was hung in a very good place.
</p>

<p>
Hayward, whom Philip had not seen since he left Heidelberg, arrived in Paris to
spend a few days in time to come to the party which Lawson and Philip were
giving in their studio to celebrate the hanging of Lawson&rsquo;s pictures.
Philip had been eager to see Hayward again, but when at last they met, he
experienced some disappointment. Hayward had altered a little in appearance:
his fine hair was thinner, and with the rapid wilting of the very fair, he was
becoming wizened and colourless; his blue eyes were paler than they had been,
and there was a muzziness about his features. On the other hand, in mind he did
not seem to have changed at all, and the culture which had impressed Philip at
eighteen aroused somewhat the contempt of Philip at twenty-one. He had altered
a good deal himself, and regarding with scorn all his old opinions of art,
life, and letters, had no patience with anyone who still held them. He was
scarcely conscious of the fact that he wanted to show off before Hayward, but
when he took him round the galleries he poured out to him all the revolutionary
opinions which himself had so recently adopted. He took him to Manet&rsquo;s
Olympia and said dramatically:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I would give all the old masters except Velasquez, Rembrandt, and
Vermeer for that one picture.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who was Vermeer?&rdquo; asked Hayward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my dear fellow, don&rsquo;t you know Vermeer? You&rsquo;re not
civilised. You mustn&rsquo;t live a moment longer without making his
acquaintance. He&rsquo;s the one old master who painted like a modern.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He dragged Hayward out of the Luxembourg and hurried him off to the Louvre.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t there any more pictures here?&rdquo; asked Hayward,
with the tourist&rsquo;s passion for thoroughness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing of the least consequence. You can come and look at them by
yourself with your Baedeker.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When they arrived at the Louvre Philip led his friend down the Long Gallery.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should like to see The Gioconda,&rdquo; said Hayward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my dear fellow, it&rsquo;s only literature,&rdquo; answered Philip.
</p>

<p>
At last, in a small room, Philip stopped before The Lacemaker of Vermeer van
Delft.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s the best picture in the Louvre. It&rsquo;s exactly
like a Manet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With an expressive, eloquent thumb Philip expatiated on the charming work. He
used the jargon of the studios with overpowering effect.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I see anything so wonderful as all that in
it,&rdquo; said Hayward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s a painter&rsquo;s picture,&rdquo; said Philip.
&ldquo;I can quite believe the layman would see nothing much in it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The what?&rdquo; said Hayward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The layman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Like most people who cultivate an interest in the arts, Hayward was extremely
anxious to be right. He was dogmatic with those who did not venture to assert
themselves, but with the self-assertive he was very modest. He was impressed by
Philip&rsquo;s assurance, and accepted meekly Philip&rsquo;s implied suggestion
that the painter&rsquo;s arrogant claim to be the sole possible judge of
painting has anything but its impertinence to recommend it.
</p>

<p>
A day or two later Philip and Lawson gave their party. Cronshaw, making an
exception in their favour, agreed to eat their food; and Miss Chalice offered
to come and cook for them. She took no interest in her own sex and declined the
suggestion that other girls should be asked for her sake. Clutton, Flanagan,
Potter, and two others made up the party. Furniture was scarce, so the model
stand was used as a table, and the guests were to sit on portmanteaux if they
liked, and if they didn&rsquo;t on the floor. The feast consisted of a
pot-au-feu, which Miss Chalice had made, of a leg of mutton roasted round the
corner and brought round hot and savoury (Miss Chalice had cooked the potatoes,
and the studio was redolent of the carrots she had fried; fried carrots were
her specialty); and this was to be followed by poires flambees, pears with
burning brandy, which Cronshaw had volunteered to make. The meal was to finish
with an enormous fromage de Brie, which stood near the window and added
fragrant odours to all the others which filled the studio. Cronshaw sat in the
place of honour on a Gladstone bag, with his legs curled under him like a
Turkish bashaw, beaming good-naturedly on the young people who surrounded him.
From force of habit, though the small studio with the stove lit was very hot,
he kept on his great-coat, with the collar turned up, and his bowler hat: he
looked with satisfaction on the four large fiaschi of Chianti which stood in
front of him in a row, two on each side of a bottle of whiskey; he said it
reminded him of a slim fair Circassian guarded by four corpulent eunuchs.
Hayward in order to put the rest of them at their ease had clothed himself in a
tweed suit and a Trinity Hall tie. He looked grotesquely British. The others
were elaborately polite to him, and during the soup they talked of the weather
and the political situation. There was a pause while they waited for the leg of
mutton, and Miss Chalice lit a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair,&rdquo; she said suddenly.
</p>

<p>
With an elegant gesture she untied a ribbon so that her tresses fell over her
shoulders. She shook her head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I always feel more comfortable with my hair down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With her large brown eyes, thin, ascetic face, her pale skin, and broad
forehead, she might have stepped out of a picture by Burne-Jones. She had long,
beautiful hands, with fingers deeply stained by nicotine. She wore sweeping
draperies, mauve and green. There was about her the romantic air of High
Street, Kensington. She was wantonly aesthetic; but she was an excellent
creature, kind and good natured; and her affectations were but skin-deep. There
was a knock at the door, and they all gave a shout of exultation. Miss Chalice
rose and opened. She took the leg of mutton and held it high above her, as
though it were the head of John the Baptist on a platter; and, the cigarette
still in her mouth, advanced with solemn, hieratic steps.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hail, daughter of Herodias,&rdquo; cried Cronshaw.
</p>

<p>
The mutton was eaten with gusto, and it did one good to see what a hearty
appetite the pale-faced lady had. Clutton and Potter sat on each side of her,
and everyone knew that neither had found her unduly coy. She grew tired of most
people in six weeks, but she knew exactly how to treat afterwards the gentlemen
who had laid their young hearts at her feet. She bore them no ill-will, though
having loved them she had ceased to do so, and treated them with friendliness
but without familiarity. Now and then she looked at Lawson with melancholy
eyes. The poires flambees were a great success, partly because of the brandy,
and partly because Miss Chalice insisted that they should be eaten with the
cheese.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s perfectly delicious, or whether
I&rsquo;m just going to vomit,&rdquo; she said, after she had thoroughly tried
the mixture.
</p>

<p>
Coffee and cognac followed with sufficient speed to prevent any untoward
consequence, and they settled down to smoke in comfort. Ruth Chalice, who could
do nothing that was not deliberately artistic, arranged herself in a graceful
attitude by Cronshaw and just rested her exquisite head on his shoulder. She
looked into the dark abyss of time with brooding eyes, and now and then with a
long meditative glance at Lawson she sighed deeply.
</p>

<p>
Then came the summer, and restlessness seized these young people. The blue
skies lured them to the sea, and the pleasant breeze sighing through the leaves
of the plane-trees on the boulevard drew them towards the country. Everyone
made plans for leaving Paris; they discussed what was the most suitable size
for the canvases they meant to take; they laid in stores of panels for
sketching; they argued about the merits of various places in Brittany. Flanagan
and Potter went to Concarneau; Mrs. Otter and her mother, with a natural
instinct for the obvious, went to Pont-Aven; Philip and Lawson made up their
minds to go to the forest of Fontainebleau, and Miss Chalice knew of a very
good hotel at Moret where there was lots of stuff to paint; it was near Paris,
and neither Philip nor Lawson was indifferent to the railway fare. Ruth Chalice
would be there, and Lawson had an idea for a portrait of her in the open air.
Just then the Salon was full of portraits of people in gardens, in sunlight,
with blinking eyes and green reflections of sunlit leaves on their faces. They
asked Clutton to go with them, but he preferred spending the summer by himself.
He had just discovered Cezanne, and was eager to go to Provence; he wanted
heavy skies from which the hot blue seemed to drip like beads of sweat, and
broad white dusty roads, and pale roofs out of which the sun had burnt the
colour, and olive trees gray with heat.
</p>

<p>
The day before they were to start, after the morning class, Philip, putting his
things together, spoke to Fanny Price.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m off tomorrow,&rdquo; he said cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Off where?&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going
away?&rdquo; Her face fell.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going away for the summer. Aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m staying in Paris. I thought you were going to stay too. I
was looking forward….&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She stopped and shrugged her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t it be frightfully hot here? It&rsquo;s awfully bad for
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Much you care if it&rsquo;s bad for me. Where are you going?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Moret.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Chalice is going there. You&rsquo;re not going with her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lawson and I are going. And she&rsquo;s going there too. I don&rsquo;t
know that we&rsquo;re actually going together.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She gave a low guttural sound, and her large face grew dark and red.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How filthy! I thought you were a decent fellow. You were about the only
one here. She&rsquo;s been with Clutton and Potter and Flanagan, even with old
Foinet&mdash;that&rsquo;s why he takes so much trouble about her&mdash;and now
two of you, you and Lawson. It makes me sick.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, what nonsense! She&rsquo;s a very decent sort. One treats her just
as if she were a man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t speak to me, don&rsquo;t speak to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But what can it matter to you?&rdquo; asked Philip. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
really no business of yours where I spend my summer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was looking forward to it so much,&rdquo; she gasped, speaking it
seemed almost to herself. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you had the money to go
away, and there wouldn&rsquo;t have been anyone else here, and we could have
worked together, and we&rsquo;d have gone to see things.&rdquo; Then her
thoughts flung back to Ruth Chalice. &ldquo;The filthy beast,&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t fit to speak to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip looked at her with a sinking heart. He was not a man to think girls were
in love with him; he was too conscious of his deformity, and he felt awkward
and clumsy with women; but he did not know what else this outburst could mean.
Fanny Price, in the dirty brown dress, with her hair falling over her face,
sloppy, untidy, stood before him; and tears of anger rolled down her cheeks.
She was repellent. Philip glanced at the door, instinctively hoping that
someone would come in and put an end to the scene.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just the same as all of them. You take all you can get, and
you don&rsquo;t even say thank you. I&rsquo;ve taught you everything you know.
No one else would take any trouble with you. Has Foinet ever bothered about
you? And I can tell you this&mdash;you can work here for a thousand years and
you&rsquo;ll never do any good. You haven&rsquo;t got any talent. You
haven&rsquo;t got any originality. And it&rsquo;s not only me&mdash;they all
say it. You&rsquo;ll never be a painter as long as you live.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is no business of yours either, is it?&rdquo; said Philip,
flushing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you think it&rsquo;s only my temper. Ask Clutton, ask Lawson, ask
Chalice. Never, never, never. You haven&rsquo;t got it in you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip shrugged his shoulders and walked out. She shouted after him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never, never, never.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Moret was in those days an old-fashioned town of one street at the edge of the
forest of Fontainebleau, and the Ecu d&rsquo;Or was a hotel which still had
about it the decrepit air of the Ancien Regime. It faced the winding river, the
Loing; and Miss Chalice had a room with a little terrace overlooking it, with a
charming view of the old bridge and its fortified gateway. They sat here in the
evenings after dinner, drinking coffee, smoking, and discussing art. There ran
into the river, a little way off, a narrow canal bordered by poplars, and along
the banks of this after their day&rsquo;s work they often wandered. They spent
all day painting. Like most of their generation they were obsessed by the fear
of the picturesque, and they turned their backs on the obvious beauty of the
town to seek subjects which were devoid of a prettiness they despised. Sisley
and Monet had painted the canal with its poplars, and they felt a desire to try
their hands at what was so typical of France; but they were frightened of its
formal beauty, and set themselves deliberately to avoid it. Miss Chalice, who
had a clever dexterity which impressed Lawson notwithstanding his contempt for
feminine art, started a picture in which she tried to circumvent the
commonplace by leaving out the tops of the trees; and Lawson had the brilliant
idea of putting in his foreground a large blue advertisement of chocolat Menier
in order to emphasise his abhorrence of the chocolate box.
</p>

<p>
Philip began now to paint in oils. He experienced a thrill of delight when
first he used that grateful medium. He went out with Lawson in the morning with
his little box and sat by him painting a panel; it gave him so much
satisfaction that he did not realise he was doing no more than copy; he was so
much under his friend&rsquo;s influence that he saw only with his eyes. Lawson
painted very low in tone, and they both saw the emerald of the grass like dark
velvet, while the brilliance of the sky turned in their hands to a brooding
ultramarine. Through July they had one fine day after another; it was very hot;
and the heat, searing Philip&rsquo;s heart, filled him with languor; he could
not work; his mind was eager with a thousand thoughts. Often he spent the
mornings by the side of the canal in the shade of the poplars, reading a few
lines and then dreaming for half an hour. Sometimes he hired a rickety bicycle
and rode along the dusty road that led to the forest, and then lay down in a
clearing. His head was full of romantic fancies. The ladies of Watteau, gay and
insouciant, seemed to wander with their cavaliers among the great trees,
whispering to one another careless, charming things, and yet somehow oppressed
by a nameless fear.
</p>

<p>
They were alone in the hotel but for a fat Frenchwoman of middle age, a
Rabelaisian figure with a broad, obscene laugh. She spent the day by the river
patiently fishing for fish she never caught, and Philip sometimes went down and
talked to her. He found out that she had belonged to a profession whose most
notorious member for our generation was Mrs. Warren, and having made a
competence she now lived the quiet life of the bourgeoise. She told Philip lewd
stories.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must go to Seville,&rdquo; she said&mdash;she spoke a little broken
English. &ldquo;The most beautiful women in the world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She leered and nodded her head. Her triple chin, her large belly, shook with
inward laughter.
</p>

<p>
It grew so hot that it was almost impossible to sleep at night. The heat seemed
to linger under the trees as though it were a material thing. They did not wish
to leave the starlit night, and the three of them would sit on the terrace of
Ruth Chalice&rsquo;s room, silent, hour after hour, too tired to talk any more,
but in voluptuous enjoyment of the stillness. They listened to the murmur of
the river. The church clock struck one and two and sometimes three before they
could drag themselves to bed. Suddenly Philip became aware that Ruth Chalice
and Lawson were lovers. He divined it in the way the girl looked at the young
painter, and in his air of possession; and as Philip sat with them he felt a
kind of effluence surrounding them, as though the air were heavy with something
strange. The revelation was a shock. He had looked upon Miss Chalice as a very
good fellow and he liked to talk to her, but it had never seemed to him
possible to enter into a closer relationship. One Sunday they had all gone with
a tea-basket into the forest, and when they came to a glade which was suitably
sylvan, Miss Chalice, because it was idyllic, insisted on taking off her shoes
and stockings. It would have been very charming only her feet were rather large
and she had on both a large corn on the third toe. Philip felt it made her
proceeding a little ridiculous. But now he looked upon her quite differently;
there was something softly feminine in her large eyes and her olive skin; he
felt himself a fool not to have seen that she was attractive. He thought he
detected in her a touch of contempt for him, because he had not had the sense
to see that she was there, in his way, and in Lawson a suspicion of
superiority. He was envious of Lawson, and he was jealous, not of the
individual concerned, but of his love. He wished that he was standing in his
shoes and feeling with his heart. He was troubled, and the fear seized him that
love would pass him by. He wanted a passion to seize him, he wanted to be swept
off his feet and borne powerless in a mighty rush he cared not whither. Miss
Chalice and Lawson seemed to him now somehow different, and the constant
companionship with them made him restless. He was dissatisfied with himself.
Life was not giving him what he wanted, and he had an uneasy feeling that he
was losing his time.
</p>

<p>
The stout Frenchwoman soon guessed what the relations were between the couple,
and talked of the matter to Philip with the utmost frankness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; she said, with the tolerant smile of one who had
fattened on the lust of her fellows, &ldquo;have you got a petite amie?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Philip, blushing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And why not? C&rsquo;est de votre age.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He shrugged his shoulders. He had a volume of Verlaine in his hands, and he
wandered off. He tried to read, but his passion was too strong. He thought of
the stray amours to which he had been introduced by Flanagan, the sly visits to
houses in a cul-de-sac, with the drawing-room in Utrecht velvet, and the
mercenary graces of painted women. He shuddered. He threw himself on the grass,
stretching his limbs like a young animal freshly awaked from sleep; and the
rippling water, the poplars gently tremulous in the faint breeze, the blue sky,
were almost more than he could bear. He was in love with love. In his fancy he
felt the kiss of warm lips on his, and around his neck the touch of soft hands.
He imagined himself in the arms of Ruth Chalice, he thought of her dark eyes
and the wonderful texture of her skin; he was mad to have let such a wonderful
adventure slip through his fingers. And if Lawson had done it why should not
he? But this was only when he did not see her, when he lay awake at night or
dreamed idly by the side of the canal; when he saw her he felt suddenly quite
different; he had no desire to take her in his arms, and he could not imagine
himself kissing her. It was very curious. Away from her he thought her
beautiful, remembering only her magnificent eyes and the creamy pallor of her
face; but when he was with her he saw only that she was flat-chested and that
her teeth were slightly decayed; he could not forget the corns on her toes. He
could not understand himself. Would he always love only in absence and be
prevented from enjoying anything when he had the chance by that deformity of
vision which seemed to exaggerate the revolting?
</p>

<p>
He was not sorry when a change in the weather, announcing the definite end of
the long summer, drove them all back to Paris.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>XLVIII</h2>

<p>
When Philip returned to Amitrano&rsquo;s he found that Fanny Price was no
longer working there. She had given up the key of her locker. He asked Mrs.
Otter whether she knew what had become of her; and Mrs. Otter, with a shrug of
the shoulders, answered that she had probably gone back to England. Philip was
relieved. He was profoundly bored by her ill-temper. Moreover she insisted on
advising him about his work, looked upon it as a slight when he did not follow
her precepts, and would not understand that he felt himself no longer the
duffer he had been at first. Soon he forgot all about her. He was working in
oils now and he was full of enthusiasm. He hoped to have something done of
sufficient importance to send to the following year&rsquo;s Salon. Lawson was
painting a portrait of Miss Chalice. She was very paintable, and all the young
men who had fallen victims to her charm had made portraits of her. A natural
indolence, joined with a passion for picturesque attitude, made her an
excellent sitter; and she had enough technical knowledge to offer useful
criticisms. Since her passion for art was chiefly a passion to live the life of
artists, she was quite content to neglect her own work. She liked the warmth of
the studio, and the opportunity to smoke innumerable cigarettes; and she spoke
in a low, pleasant voice of the love of art and the art of love. She made no
clear distinction between the two.
</p>

<p>
Lawson was painting with infinite labour, working till he could hardly stand
for days and then scraping out all he had done. He would have exhausted the
patience of anyone but Ruth Chalice. At last he got into a hopeless muddle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The only thing is to take a new canvas and start fresh,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I know exactly what I want now, and it won&rsquo;t take me long.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was present at the time, and Miss Chalice said to him:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you paint me too? You&rsquo;ll be able to learn a lot by
watching Mr. Lawson.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was one of Miss Chalice&rsquo;s delicacies that she always addressed her
lovers by their surnames.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should like it awfully if Lawson wouldn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a damn,&rdquo; said Lawson.
</p>

<p>
It was the first time that Philip set about a portrait, and he began with
trepidation but also with pride. He sat by Lawson and painted as he saw him
paint. He profited by the example and by the advice which both Lawson and Miss
Chalice freely gave him. At last Lawson finished and invited Clutton in to
criticise. Clutton had only just come back to Paris. From Provence he had
drifted down to Spain, eager to see Velasquez at Madrid, and thence he had gone
to Toledo. He stayed there three months, and he was returned with a name new to
the young men: he had wonderful things to say of a painter called El Greco, who
it appeared could only be studied in Toledo.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, I know about him,&rdquo; said Lawson, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s the old
master whose distinction it is that he painted as badly as the moderns.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Clutton, more taciturn than ever, did not answer, but he looked at Lawson with
a sardonic air.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you going to show us the stuff you&rsquo;ve brought back from
Spain?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t paint in Spain, I was too busy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did you do then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought things out. I believe I&rsquo;m through with the
Impressionists; I&rsquo;ve got an idea they&rsquo;ll seem very thin and
superficial in a few years. I want to make a clean sweep of everything
I&rsquo;ve learnt and start fresh. When I came back I destroyed everything
I&rsquo;d painted. I&rsquo;ve got nothing in my studio now but an easel, my
paints, and some clean canvases.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet. I&rsquo;ve only got an inkling of what I
want.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He spoke slowly, in a curious manner, as though he were straining to hear
something which was only just audible. There seemed to be a mysterious force in
him which he himself did not understand, but which was struggling obscurely to
find an outlet. His strength impressed you. Lawson dreaded the criticism he
asked for and had discounted the blame he thought he might get by affecting a
contempt for any opinion of Clutton&rsquo;s; but Philip knew there was nothing
which would give him more pleasure than Clutton&rsquo;s praise. Clutton looked
at the portrait for some time in silence, then glanced at Philip&rsquo;s
picture, which was standing on an easel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I had a shot at a portrait too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The sedulous ape,&rdquo; he murmured.
</p>

<p>
He turned away again to Lawson&rsquo;s canvas. Philip reddened but did not
speak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what d&rsquo;you think of it?&rdquo; asked Lawson at length.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The modelling&rsquo;s jolly good,&rdquo; said Clutton. &ldquo;And I
think it&rsquo;s very well drawn.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you think the values are all right?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lawson smiled with delight. He shook himself in his clothes like a wet dog.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, I&rsquo;m jolly glad you like it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s of the smallest
importance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lawson&rsquo;s face fell, and he stared at Clutton with astonishment: he had no
notion what he meant, Clutton had no gift of expression in words, and he spoke
as though it were an effort. What he had to say was confused, halting, and
verbose; but Philip knew the words which served as the text of his rambling
discourse. Clutton, who never read, had heard them first from Cronshaw; and
though they had made small impression, they had remained in his memory; and
lately, emerging on a sudden, had acquired the character of a revelation: a
good painter had two chief objects to paint, namely, man and the intention of
his soul. The Impressionists had been occupied with other problems, they had
painted man admirably, but they had troubled themselves as little as the
English portrait painters of the eighteenth century with the intention of his
soul.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But when you try to get that you become literary,&rdquo; said Lawson,
interrupting. &ldquo;Let me paint the man like Manet, and the intention of his
soul can go to the devil.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That would be all very well if you could beat Manet at his own game, but
you can&rsquo;t get anywhere near him. You can&rsquo;t feed yourself on the day
before yesterday, it&rsquo;s ground which has been swept dry. You must go back.
It&rsquo;s when I saw the Grecos that I felt one could get something more out
of portraits than we knew before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just going back to Ruskin,&rdquo; cried Lawson.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No&mdash;you see, he went for morality: I don&rsquo;t care a damn for
morality: teaching doesn&rsquo;t come in, ethics and all that, but passion and
emotion. The greatest portrait painters have painted both, man and the
intention of his soul; Rembrandt and El Greco; it&rsquo;s only the
second-raters who&rsquo;ve only painted man. A lily of the valley would be
lovely even if it didn&rsquo;t smell, but it&rsquo;s more lovely because it has
perfume. That picture&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed to Lawson&rsquo;s
portrait&mdash;&ldquo;well, the drawing&rsquo;s all right and so&rsquo;s the
modelling all right, but just conventional; it ought to be drawn and modelled
so that you know the girl&rsquo;s a lousy slut. Correctness is all very well:
El Greco made his people eight feet high because he wanted to express something
he couldn&rsquo;t get any other way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Damn El Greco,&rdquo; said Lawson, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the good of
jawing about a man when we haven&rsquo;t a chance of seeing any of his
work?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Clutton shrugged his shoulders, smoked a cigarette in silence, and went away.
Philip and Lawson looked at one another.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in what he says,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
Lawson stared ill-temperedly at his picture.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How the devil is one to get the intention of the soul except by painting
exactly what one sees?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
About this time Philip made a new friend. On Monday morning models assembled at
the school in order that one might be chosen for the week, and one day a young
man was taken who was plainly not a model by profession. Philip&rsquo;s
attention was attracted by the manner in which he held himself: when he got on
to the stand he stood firmly on both feet, square, with clenched hands, and
with his head defiantly thrown forward; the attitude emphasised his fine
figure; there was no fat on him, and his muscles stood out as though they were
of iron. His head, close-cropped, was well-shaped, and he wore a short beard;
he had large, dark eyes and heavy eyebrows. He held the pose hour after hour
without appearance of fatigue. There was in his mien a mixture of shame and of
determination. His air of passionate energy excited Philip&rsquo;s romantic
imagination, and when, the sitting ended, he saw him in his clothes, it seemed
to him that he wore them as though he were a king in rags. He was
uncommunicative, but in a day or two Mrs. Otter told Philip that the model was
a Spaniard and that he had never sat before.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose he was starving,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you noticed his clothes? They&rsquo;re quite neat and decent,
aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It chanced that Potter, one of the Americans who worked at Amitrano&rsquo;s,
was going to Italy for a couple of months, and offered his studio to Philip.
Philip was pleased. He was growing a little impatient of Lawson&rsquo;s
peremptory advice and wanted to be by himself. At the end of the week he went
up to the model and on the pretence that his drawing was not finished asked
whether he would come and sit to him one day.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a model,&rdquo; the Spaniard answered. &ldquo;I have other
things to do next week.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come and have luncheon with me now, and we&rsquo;ll talk about
it,&rdquo; said Philip, and as the other hesitated, he added with a smile:
&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t hurt you to lunch with me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With a shrug of the shoulders the model consented, and they went off to a
cremerie. The Spaniard spoke broken French, fluent but difficult to follow, and
Philip managed to get on well enough with him. He found out that he was a
writer. He had come to Paris to write novels and kept himself meanwhile by all
the expedients possible to a penniless man; he gave lessons, he did any
translations he could get hold of, chiefly business documents, and at last had
been driven to make money by his fine figure. Sitting was well paid, and what
he had earned during the last week was enough to keep him for two more; he told
Philip, amazed, that he could live easily on two francs a day; but it filled
him with shame that he was obliged to show his body for money, and he looked
upon sitting as a degradation which only hunger could excuse. Philip explained
that he did not want him to sit for the figure, but only for the head; he
wished to do a portrait of him which he might send to the next Salon.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why should you want to paint me?&rdquo; asked the Spaniard.
</p>

<p>
Philip answered that the head interested him, he thought he could do a good
portrait.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford the time. I grudge every minute that I have to rob
from my writing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But it would only be in the afternoon. I work at the school in the
morning. After all, it&rsquo;s better to sit to me than to do translations of
legal documents.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There were legends in the Latin quarter of a time when students of different
countries lived together intimately, but this was long since passed, and now
the various nations were almost as much separated as in an Oriental city. At
Julian&rsquo;s and at the Beaux Arts a French student was looked upon with
disfavour by his fellow-countrymen when he consorted with foreigners, and it
was difficult for an Englishman to know more than quite superficially any
native inhabitants of the city in which he dwelt. Indeed, many of the students
after living in Paris for five years knew no more French than served them in
shops and lived as English a life as though they were working in South
Kensington.
</p>

<p>
Philip, with his passion for the romantic, welcomed the opportunity to get in
touch with a Spaniard; he used all his persuasiveness to overcome the
man&rsquo;s reluctance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said the Spaniard at
last. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sit to you, but not for money, for my own
pleasure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip expostulated, but the other was firm, and at length they arranged that
he should come on the following Monday at one o&rsquo;clock. He gave Philip a
card on which was printed his name: Miguel Ajuria.
</p>

<p>
Miguel sat regularly, and though he refused to accept payment he borrowed fifty
francs from Philip every now and then: it was a little more expensive than if
Philip had paid for the sittings in the usual way; but gave the Spaniard a
satisfactory feeling that he was not earning his living in a degrading manner.
His nationality made Philip regard him as a representative of romance, and he
asked him about Seville and Granada, Velasquez and Calderon. But Miguel had no
patience with the grandeur of his country. For him, as for so many of his
compatriots, France was the only country for a man of intelligence and Paris
the centre of the world.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Spain is dead,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It has no writers, it has no art,
it has nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Little by little, with the exuberant rhetoric of his race, he revealed his
ambitions. He was writing a novel which he hoped would make his name. He was
under the influence of Zola, and he had set his scene in Paris. He told Philip
the story at length. To Philip it seemed crude and stupid; the naive
obscenity&mdash;c&rsquo;est la vie, mon cher, c&rsquo;est la vie, he
cried&mdash;the naive obscenity served only to emphasise the conventionality of
the anecdote. He had written for two years, amid incredible hardships, denying
himself all the pleasures of life which had attracted him to Paris, fighting
with starvation for art&rsquo;s sake, determined that nothing should hinder his
great achievement. The effort was heroic.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why don&rsquo;t you write about Spain?&rdquo; cried Philip.
&ldquo;It would be so much more interesting. You know the life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But Paris is the only place worth writing about. Paris is life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
One day he brought part of the manuscript, and in his bad French, translating
excitedly as he went along so that Philip could scarcely understand, he read
passages. It was lamentable. Philip, puzzled, looked at the picture he was
painting: the mind behind that broad brow was trivial; and the flashing,
passionate eyes saw nothing in life but the obvious. Philip was not satisfied
with his portrait, and at the end of a sitting he nearly always scraped out
what he had done. It was all very well to aim at the intention of the soul: who
could tell what that was when people seemed a mass of contradictions? He liked
Miguel, and it distressed him to realise that his magnificent struggle was
futile: he had everything to make a good writer but talent. Philip looked at
his own work. How could you tell whether there was anything in it or whether
you were wasting your time? It was clear that the will to achieve could not
help you and confidence in yourself meant nothing. Philip thought of Fanny
Price; she had a vehement belief in her talent; her strength of will was
extraordinary.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I thought I wasn&rsquo;t going to be really good, I&rsquo;d rather
give up painting,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any use in being
a second-rate painter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then one morning when he was going out, the concierge called out to him that
there was a letter. Nobody wrote to him but his Aunt Louisa and sometimes
Hayward, and this was a handwriting he did not know. The letter was as follows:
</p>

<p>
Please come at once when you get this. I couldn&rsquo;t put up with it any
more. Please come yourself. I can&rsquo;t bear the thought that anyone else
should touch me. I want you to have everything.
</p>

<p>
F. Price
</p>

<p>
I have not had anything to eat for three days.
</p>

<p>
Philip felt on a sudden sick with fear. He hurried to the house in which she
lived. He was astonished that she was in Paris at all. He had not seen her for
months and imagined she had long since returned to England. When he arrived he
asked the concierge whether she was in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve not seen her go out for two days.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip ran upstairs and knocked at the door. There was no reply. He called her
name. The door was locked, and on bending down he found the key was in the
lock.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my God, I hope she hasn&rsquo;t done something awful,&rdquo; he
cried aloud.
</p>

<p>
He ran down and told the porter that she was certainly in the room. He had had
a letter from her and feared a terrible accident. He suggested breaking open
the door. The porter, who had been sullen and disinclined to listen, became
alarmed; he could not take the responsibility of breaking into the room; they
must go for the commissaire de police. They walked together to the bureau, and
then they fetched a locksmith. Philip found that Miss Price had not paid the
last quarter&rsquo;s rent: on New Year&rsquo;s Day she had not given the
concierge the present which old-established custom led him to regard as a
right. The four of them went upstairs, and they knocked again at the door.
There was no reply. The locksmith set to work, and at last they entered the
room. Philip gave a cry and instinctively covered his eyes with his hands. The
wretched woman was hanging with a rope round her neck, which she had tied to a
hook in the ceiling fixed by some previous tenant to hold up the curtains of
the bed. She had moved her own little bed out of the way and had stood on a
chair, which had been kicked away. It was lying on its side on the floor. They
cut her down. The body was quite cold.
</p>

<h2>XLIX</h2>

<p>
The story which Philip made out in one way and another was terrible. One of the
grievances of the women-students was that Fanny Price would never share their
gay meals in restaurants, and the reason was obvious: she had been oppressed by
dire poverty. He remembered the luncheon they had eaten together when first he
came to Paris and the ghoulish appetite which had disgusted him: he realised
now that she ate in that manner because she was ravenous. The concierge told
him what her food had consisted of. A bottle of milk was left for her every day
and she brought in her own loaf of bread; she ate half the loaf and drank half
the milk at mid-day when she came back from the school, and consumed the rest
in the evening. It was the same day after day. Philip thought with anguish of
what she must have endured. She had never given anyone to understand that she
was poorer than the rest, but it was clear that her money had been coming to an
end, and at last she could not afford to come any more to the studio. The
little room was almost bare of furniture, and there were no other clothes than
the shabby brown dress she had always worn. Philip searched among her things
for the address of some friend with whom he could communicate. He found a piece
of paper on which his own name was written a score of times. It gave him a
peculiar shock. He supposed it was true that she had loved him; he thought of
the emaciated body, in the brown dress, hanging from the nail in the ceiling;
and he shuddered. But if she had cared for him why did she not let him help
her? He would so gladly have done all he could. He felt remorseful because he
had refused to see that she looked upon him with any particular feeling, and
now these words in her letter were infinitely pathetic: I can&rsquo;t bear the
thought that anyone else should touch me. She had died of starvation.
</p>

<p>
Philip found at length a letter signed: your loving brother, Albert. It was two
or three weeks old, dated from some road in Surbiton, and refused a loan of
five pounds. The writer had his wife and family to think of, he didn&rsquo;t
feel justified in lending money, and his advice was that Fanny should come back
to London and try to get a situation. Philip telegraphed to Albert Price, and
in a little while an answer came:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Deeply distressed. Very awkward to leave my business. Is presence
essential. Price.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip wired a succinct affirmative, and next morning a stranger presented
himself at the studio.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Price,&rdquo; he said, when Philip opened the door.
</p>

<p>
He was a commonish man in black with a band round his bowler hat; he had
something of Fanny&rsquo;s clumsy look; he wore a stubbly moustache, and had a
cockney accent. Philip asked him to come in. He cast sidelong glances round the
studio while Philip gave him details of the accident and told him what he had
done.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I needn&rsquo;t see her, need I?&rdquo; asked Albert Price. &ldquo;My
nerves aren&rsquo;t very strong, and it takes very little to upset me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He began to talk freely. He was a rubber-merchant, and he had a wife and three
children. Fanny was a governess, and he couldn&rsquo;t make out why she
hadn&rsquo;t stuck to that instead of coming to Paris.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Me and Mrs. Price told her Paris was no place for a girl. And
there&rsquo;s no money in art&mdash;never &rsquo;as been.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was plain enough that he had not been on friendly terms with his sister, and
he resented her suicide as a last injury that she had done him. He did not like
the idea that she had been forced to it by poverty; that seemed to reflect on
the family. The idea struck him that possibly there was a more respectable
reason for her act.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose she &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t any trouble with a man, &rsquo;ad she?
You know what I mean, Paris and all that. She might &rsquo;ave done it so as
not to disgrace herself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip felt himself reddening and cursed his weakness. Price&rsquo;s keen
little eyes seemed to suspect him of an intrigue.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I believe your sister to have been perfectly virtuous,&rdquo; he
answered acidly. &ldquo;She killed herself because she was starving.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s very &rsquo;ard on her family, Mr. Carey. She only
&rsquo;ad to write to me. I wouldn&rsquo;t have let my sister want.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip had found the brother&rsquo;s address only by reading the letter in
which he refused a loan; but he shrugged his shoulders: there was no use in
recrimination. He hated the little man and wanted to have done with him as soon
as possible. Albert Price also wished to get through the necessary business
quickly so that he could get back to London. They went to the tiny room in
which poor Fanny had lived. Albert Price looked at the pictures and the
furniture.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pretend to know much about art,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
suppose these pictures would fetch something, would they?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The furniture&rsquo;s not worth ten shillings.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Albert Price knew no French and Philip had to do everything. It seemed that it
was an interminable process to get the poor body safely hidden away under
ground: papers had to be obtained in one place and signed in another; officials
had to be seen. For three days Philip was occupied from morning till night. At
last he and Albert Price followed the hearse to the cemetery at Montparnasse.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want to do the thing decent,&rdquo; said Albert Price, &ldquo;but
there&rsquo;s no use wasting money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The short ceremony was infinitely dreadful in the cold gray morning. Half a
dozen people who had worked with Fanny Price at the studio came to the funeral,
Mrs. Otter because she was massiere and thought it her duty, Ruth Chalice
because she had a kind heart, Lawson, Clutton, and Flanagan. They had all
disliked her during her life. Philip, looking across the cemetery crowded on
all sides with monuments, some poor and simple, others vulgar, pretentious, and
ugly, shuddered. It was horribly sordid. When they came out Albert Price asked
Philip to lunch with him. Philip loathed him now and he was tired; he had not
been sleeping well, for he dreamed constantly of Fanny Price in the torn brown
dress, hanging from the nail in the ceiling; but he could not think of an
excuse.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You take me somewhere where we can get a regular slap-up lunch. All this
is the very worst thing for my nerves.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lavenue&rsquo;s is about the best place round here,&rdquo; answered
Philip.
</p>

<p>
Albert Price settled himself on a velvet seat with a sigh of relief. He ordered
a substantial luncheon and a bottle of wine.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m glad that&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
He threw out a few artful questions, and Philip discovered that he was eager to
hear about the painter&rsquo;s life in Paris. He represented it to himself as
deplorable, but he was anxious for details of the orgies which his fancy
suggested to him. With sly winks and discreet sniggering he conveyed that he
knew very well that there was a great deal more than Philip confessed. He was a
man of the world, and he knew a thing or two. He asked Philip whether he had
ever been to any of those places in Montmartre which are celebrated from Temple
Bar to the Royal Exchange. He would like to say he had been to the Moulin
Rouge. The luncheon was very good and the wine excellent. Albert Price expanded
as the processes of digestion went satisfactorily forwards.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s &rsquo;ave a little brandy,&rdquo; he said when the coffee
was brought, &ldquo;and blow the expense.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He rubbed his hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;alf a mind to stay over tonight and go
back tomorrow. What d&rsquo;you say to spending the evening together?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you mean you want me to take you round Montmartre tonight, I&rsquo;ll
see you damned,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose it wouldn&rsquo;t be quite the thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The answer was made so seriously that Philip was tickled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Besides it would be rotten for your nerves,&rdquo; he said gravely.
</p>

<p>
Albert Price concluded that he had better go back to London by the four
o&rsquo;clock train, and presently he took leave of Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, good-bye, old man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I tell you what,
I&rsquo;ll try and come over to Paris again one of these days and I&rsquo;ll
look you up. And then we won&rsquo;t &rsquo;alf go on the razzle.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was too restless to work that afternoon, so he jumped on a bus and
crossed the river to see whether there were any pictures on view at
Durand-Ruel&rsquo;s. After that he strolled along the boulevard. It was cold
and wind-swept. People hurried by wrapped up in their coats, shrunk together in
an effort to keep out of the cold, and their faces were pinched and careworn.
It was icy underground in the cemetery at Montparnasse among all those white
tombstones. Philip felt lonely in the world and strangely homesick. He wanted
company. At that hour Cronshaw would be working, and Clutton never welcomed
visitors; Lawson was painting another portrait of Ruth Chalice and would not
care to be disturbed. He made up his mind to go and see Flanagan. He found him
painting, but delighted to throw up his work and talk. The studio was
comfortable, for the American had more money than most of them, and warm;
Flanagan set about making tea. Philip looked at the two heads that he was
sending to the Salon.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful cheek my sending anything,&rdquo; said Flanagan,
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t care, I&rsquo;m going to send. D&rsquo;you think
they&rsquo;re rotten?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not so rotten as I should have expected,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
They showed in fact an astounding cleverness. The difficulties had been avoided
with skill, and there was a dash about the way in which the paint was put on
which was surprising and even attractive. Flanagan, without knowledge or
technique, painted with the loose brush of a man who has spent a lifetime in
the practice of the art.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If one were forbidden to look at any picture for more than thirty
seconds you&rsquo;d be a great master, Flanagan,&rdquo; smiled Philip.
</p>

<p>
These young people were not in the habit of spoiling one another with excessive
flattery.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t got time in America to spend more than thirty seconds
in looking at any picture,&rdquo; laughed the other.
</p>

<p>
Flanagan, though he was the most scatter-brained person in the world, had a
tenderness of heart which was unexpected and charming. Whenever anyone was ill
he installed himself as sick-nurse. His gaiety was better than any medicine.
Like many of his countrymen he had not the English dread of sentimentality
which keeps so tight a hold on emotion; and, finding nothing absurd in the show
of feeling, could offer an exuberant sympathy which was often grateful to his
friends in distress. He saw that Philip was depressed by what he had gone
through and with unaffected kindliness set himself boisterously to cheer him
up. He exaggerated the Americanisms which he knew always made the Englishmen
laugh and poured out a breathless stream of conversation, whimsical,
high-spirited, and jolly. In due course they went out to dinner and afterwards
to the Gaite Montparnasse, which was Flanagan&rsquo;s favourite place of
amusement. By the end of the evening he was in his most extravagant humour. He
had drunk a good deal, but any inebriety from which he suffered was due much
more to his own vivacity than to alcohol. He proposed that they should go to
the Bal Bullier, and Philip, feeling too tired to go to bed, willingly enough
consented. They sat down at a table on the platform at the side, raised a
little from the level of the floor so that they could watch the dancing, and
drank a bock. Presently Flanagan saw a friend and with a wild shout leaped over
the barrier on to the space where they were dancing. Philip watched the people.
Bullier was not the resort of fashion. It was Thursday night and the place was
crowded. There were a number of students of the various faculties, but most of
the men were clerks or assistants in shops; they wore their everyday clothes,
ready-made tweeds or queer tail-coats, and their hats, for they had brought
them in with them, and when they danced there was no place to put them but
their heads. Some of the women looked like servant-girls, and some were painted
hussies, but for the most part they were shop-girls. They were poorly-dressed
in cheap imitation of the fashions on the other side of the river. The hussies
were got up to resemble the music-hall artiste or the dancer who enjoyed
notoriety at the moment; their eyes were heavy with black and their cheeks
impudently scarlet. The hall was lit by great white lights, low down, which
emphasised the shadows on the faces; all the lines seemed to harden under it,
and the colours were most crude. It was a sordid scene. Philip leaned over the
rail, staring down, and he ceased to hear the music. They danced furiously.
They danced round the room, slowly, talking very little, with all their
attention given to the dance. The room was hot, and their faces shone with
sweat. It seemed to Philip that they had thrown off the guard which people wear
on their expression, the homage to convention, and he saw them now as they
really were. In that moment of abandon they were strangely animal: some were
foxy and some were wolf-like; and others had the long, foolish face of sheep.
Their skins were sallow from the unhealthy life they led and the poor food they
ate. Their features were blunted by mean interests, and their little eyes were
shifty and cunning. There was nothing of nobility in their bearing, and you
felt that for all of them life was a long succession of petty concerns and
sordid thoughts. The air was heavy with the musty smell of humanity. But they
danced furiously as though impelled by some strange power within them, and it
seemed to Philip that they were driven forward by a rage for enjoyment. They
were seeking desperately to escape from a world of horror. The desire for
pleasure which Cronshaw said was the only motive of human action urged them
blindly on, and the very vehemence of the desire seemed to rob it of all
pleasure. They were hurried on by a great wind, helplessly, they knew not why
and they knew not whither. Fate seemed to tower above them, and they danced as
though everlasting darkness were beneath their feet. Their silence was vaguely
alarming. It was as if life terrified them and robbed them of power of speech
so that the shriek which was in their hearts died at their throats. Their eyes
were haggard and grim; and notwithstanding the beastly lust that disfigured
them, and the meanness of their faces, and the cruelty, notwithstanding the
stupidness which was worst of all, the anguish of those fixed eyes made all
that crowd terrible and pathetic. Philip loathed them, and yet his heart ached
with the infinite pity which filled him.
</p>

<p>
He took his coat from the cloak-room and went out into the bitter coldness of
the night.

Philip could not get the unhappy event out of his head. What troubled him most
was the uselessness of Fanny&rsquo;s effort. No one could have worked harder
than she, nor with more sincerity; she believed in herself with all her heart;
but it was plain that self-confidence meant very little, all his friends had
it, Miguel Ajuria among the rest; and Philip was shocked by the contrast
between the Spaniard&rsquo;s heroic endeavour and the triviality of the thing
he attempted. The unhappiness of Philip&rsquo;s life at school had called up in
him the power of self-analysis; and this vice, as subtle as drug-taking, had
taken possession of him so that he had now a peculiar keenness in the
dissection of his feelings. He could not help seeing that art affected him
differently from others. A fine picture gave Lawson an immediate thrill. His
appreciation was instinctive. Even Flanagan felt certain things which Philip
was obliged to think out. His own appreciation was intellectual. He could not
help thinking that if he had in him the artistic temperament (he hated the
phrase, but could discover no other) he would feel beauty in the emotional,
unreasoning way in which they did. He began to wonder whether he had anything
more than a superficial cleverness of the hand which enabled him to copy
objects with accuracy. That was nothing. He had learned to despise technical
dexterity. The important thing was to feel in terms of paint. Lawson painted in
a certain way because it was his nature to, and through the imitativeness of a
student sensitive to every influence, there pierced individuality. Philip
looked at his own portrait of Ruth Chalice, and now that three months had
passed he realised that it was no more than a servile copy of Lawson. He felt
himself barren. He painted with the brain, and he could not help knowing that
the only painting worth anything was done with the heart.
</p>

<p>
He had very little money, barely sixteen hundred pounds, and it would be
necessary for him to practise the severest economy. He could not count on
earning anything for ten years. The history of painting was full of artists who
had earned nothing at all. He must resign himself to penury; and it was worth
while if he produced work which was immortal; but he had a terrible fear that
he would never be more than second-rate. Was it worth while for that to give up
one&rsquo;s youth, and the gaiety of life, and the manifold chances of being?
He knew the existence of foreign painters in Paris enough to see that the lives
they led were narrowly provincial. He knew some who had dragged along for
twenty years in the pursuit of a fame which always escaped them till they sunk
into sordidness and alcoholism. Fanny&rsquo;s suicide had aroused memories, and
Philip heard ghastly stories of the way in which one person or another had
escaped from despair. He remembered the scornful advice which the master had
given poor Fanny: it would have been well for her if she had taken it and given
up an attempt which was hopeless.
</p>

<p>
Philip finished his portrait of Miguel Ajuria and made up his mind to send it
to the Salon. Flanagan was sending two pictures, and he thought he could paint
as well as Flanagan. He had worked so hard on the portrait that he could not
help feeling it must have merit. It was true that when he looked at it he felt
that there was something wrong, though he could not tell what; but when he was
away from it his spirits went up and he was not dissatisfied. He sent it to the
Salon and it was refused. He did not mind much, since he had done all he could
to persuade himself that there was little chance that it would be taken, till
Flanagan a few days later rushed in to tell Lawson and Philip that one of his
pictures was accepted. With a blank face Philip offered his congratulations,
and Flanagan was so busy congratulating himself that he did not catch the note
of irony which Philip could not prevent from coming into his voice. Lawson,
quicker-witted, observed it and looked at Philip curiously. His own picture was
all right, he knew that a day or two before, and he was vaguely resentful of
Philip&rsquo;s attitude. But he was surprised at the sudden question which
Philip put him as soon as the American was gone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you were in my place would you chuck the whole thing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder if it&rsquo;s worth while being a second-rate painter. You see,
in other things, if you&rsquo;re a doctor or if you&rsquo;re in business, it
doesn&rsquo;t matter so much if you&rsquo;re mediocre. You make a living and
you get along. But what is the good of turning out second-rate pictures?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lawson was fond of Philip and, as soon as he thought he was seriously
distressed by the refusal of his picture, he set himself to console him. It was
notorious that the Salon had refused pictures which were afterwards famous; it
was the first time Philip had sent, and he must expect a rebuff;
Flanagan&rsquo;s success was explicable, his picture was showy and superficial:
it was just the sort of thing a languid jury would see merit in. Philip grew
impatient; it was humiliating that Lawson should think him capable of being
seriously disturbed by so trivial a calamity and would not realise that his
dejection was due to a deep-seated distrust of his powers.
</p>

<p>
Of late Clutton had withdrawn himself somewhat from the group who took their
meals at Gravier&rsquo;s, and lived very much by himself. Flanagan said he was
in love with a girl, but Clutton&rsquo;s austere countenance did not suggest
passion; and Philip thought it more probable that he separated himself from his
friends so that he might grow clear with the new ideas which were in him. But
that evening, when the others had left the restaurant to go to a play and
Philip was sitting alone, Clutton came in and ordered dinner. They began to
talk, and finding Clutton more loquacious and less sardonic than usual, Philip
determined to take advantage of his good humour.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say I wish you&rsquo;d come and look at my picture,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know what you think of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Philip, reddening.
</p>

<p>
The request was one which they all made of one another, and no one ever thought
of refusing. Clutton shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;People ask you for criticism, but they only want praise. Besides,
what&rsquo;s the good of criticism? What does it matter if your picture is good
or bad?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It matters to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. The only reason that one paints is that one can&rsquo;t help it.
It&rsquo;s a function like any of the other functions of the body, only
comparatively few people have got it. One paints for oneself: otherwise one
would commit suicide. Just think of it, you spend God knows how long trying to
get something on to canvas, putting the sweat of your soul into it, and what is
the result? Ten to one it will be refused at the Salon; if it&rsquo;s accepted,
people glance at it for ten seconds as they pass; if you&rsquo;re lucky some
ignorant fool will buy it and put it on his walls and look at it as little as
he looks at his dining-room table. Criticism has nothing to do with the artist.
It judges objectively, but the objective doesn&rsquo;t concern the
artist.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Clutton put his hands over his eyes so that he might concentrate his mind on
what he wanted to say.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The artist gets a peculiar sensation from something he sees, and is
impelled to express it and, he doesn&rsquo;t know why, he can only express his
feeling by lines and colours. It&rsquo;s like a musician; he&rsquo;ll read a
line or two, and a certain combination of notes presents itself to him: he
doesn&rsquo;t know why such and such words call forth in him such and such
notes; they just do. And I&rsquo;ll tell you another reason why criticism is
meaningless: a great painter forces the world to see nature as he sees it; but
in the next generation another painter sees the world in another way, and then
the public judges him not by himself but by his predecessor. So the Barbizon
people taught our fathers to look at trees in a certain manner, and when Monet
came along and painted differently, people said: But trees aren&rsquo;t like
that. It never struck them that trees are exactly how a painter chooses to see
them. We paint from within outwards&mdash;if we force our vision on the world
it calls us great painters; if we don&rsquo;t it ignores us; but we are the
same. We don&rsquo;t attach any meaning to greatness or to smallness. What
happens to our work afterwards is unimportant; we have got all we could out of
it while we were doing it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a pause while Clutton with voracious appetite devoured the food that
was set before him. Philip, smoking a cheap cigar, observed him closely. The
ruggedness of the head, which looked as though it were carved from a stone
refractory to the sculptor&rsquo;s chisel, the rough mane of dark hair, the
great nose, and the massive bones of the jaw, suggested a man of strength; and
yet Philip wondered whether perhaps the mask concealed a strange weakness.
Clutton&rsquo;s refusal to show his work might be sheer vanity: he could not
bear the thought of anyone&rsquo;s criticism, and he would not expose himself
to the chance of a refusal from the Salon; he wanted to be received as a master
and would not risk comparisons with other work which might force him to
diminish his own opinion of himself. During the eighteen months Philip had
known him Clutton had grown more harsh and bitter; though he would not come out
into the open and compete with his fellows, he was indignant with the facile
success of those who did. He had no patience with Lawson, and the pair were no
longer on the intimate terms upon which they had been when Philip first knew
them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lawson&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said contemptuously,
&ldquo;he&rsquo;ll go back to England, become a fashionable portrait painter,
earn ten thousand a year and be an A. R. A. before he&rsquo;s forty. Portraits
done by hand for the nobility and gentry!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip, too, looked into the future, and he saw Clutton in twenty years,
bitter, lonely, savage, and unknown; still in Paris, for the life there had got
into his bones, ruling a small cenacle with a savage tongue, at war with
himself and the world, producing little in his increasing passion for a
perfection he could not reach; and perhaps sinking at last into drunkenness. Of
late Philip had been captivated by an idea that since one had only one life it
was important to make a success of it, but he did not count success by the
acquiring of money or the achieving of fame; he did not quite know yet what he
meant by it, perhaps variety of experience and the making the most of his
abilities. It was plain anyway that the life which Clutton seemed destined to
was failure. Its only justification would be the painting of imperishable
masterpieces. He recollected Cronshaw&rsquo;s whimsical metaphor of the Persian
carpet; he had thought of it often; but Cronshaw with his faun-like humour had
refused to make his meaning clear: he repeated that it had none unless one
discovered it for oneself. It was this desire to make a success of life which
was at the bottom of Philip&rsquo;s uncertainty about continuing his artistic
career. But Clutton began to talk again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you remember my telling you about that chap I met in Brittany? I
saw him the other day here. He&rsquo;s just off to Tahiti. He was broke to the
world. He was a brasseur d&rsquo;affaires, a stockbroker I suppose you call it
in English; and he had a wife and family, and he was earning a large income. He
chucked it all to become a painter. He just went off and settled down in
Brittany and began to paint. He hadn&rsquo;t got any money and did the next
best thing to starving.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what about his wife and family?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he dropped them. He left them to starve on their own account.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It sounds a pretty low-down thing to do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my dear fellow, if you want to be a gentleman you must give up being
an artist. They&rsquo;ve got nothing to do with one another. You hear of men
painting pot-boilers to keep an aged mother&mdash;well, it shows they&rsquo;re
excellent sons, but it&rsquo;s no excuse for bad work. They&rsquo;re only
tradesmen. An artist would let his mother go to the workhouse. There&rsquo;s a
writer I know over here who told me that his wife died in childbirth. He was in
love with her and he was mad with grief, but as he sat at the bedside watching
her die he found himself making mental notes of how she looked and what she
said and the things he was feeling. Gentlemanly, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But is your friend a good painter?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, not yet, he paints just like Pissarro. He hasn&rsquo;t found
himself, but he&rsquo;s got a sense of colour and a sense of decoration. But
that isn&rsquo;t the question. It&rsquo;s the feeling, and that he&rsquo;s got.
He&rsquo;s behaved like a perfect cad to his wife and children, he&rsquo;s
always behaving like a perfect cad; the way he treats the people who&rsquo;ve
helped him&mdash;and sometimes he&rsquo;s been saved from starvation merely by
the kindness of his friends&mdash;is simply beastly. He just happens to be a
great artist.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip pondered over the man who was willing to sacrifice everything, comfort,
home, money, love, honour, duty, for the sake of getting on to canvas with
paint the emotion which the world gave him. It was magnificent, and yet his
courage failed him.
</p>

<p>
Thinking of Cronshaw recalled to him the fact that he had not seen him for a
week, and so, when Clutton left him, he wandered along to the cafe in which he
was certain to find the writer. During the first few months of his stay in
Paris Philip had accepted as gospel all that Cronshaw said, but Philip had a
practical outlook and he grew impatient with the theories which resulted in no
action. Cronshaw&rsquo;s slim bundle of poetry did not seem a substantial
result for a life which was sordid. Philip could not wrench out of his nature
the instincts of the middle-class from which he came; and the penury, the hack
work which Cronshaw did to keep body and soul together, the monotony of
existence between the slovenly attic and the cafe table, jarred with his
respectability. Cronshaw was astute enough to know that the young man
disapproved of him, and he attacked his philistinism with an irony which was
sometimes playful but often very keen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a tradesman,&rdquo; he told Philip, &ldquo;you want to
invest life in consols so that it shall bring you in a safe three per cent.
I&rsquo;m a spendthrift, I run through my capital. I shall spend my last penny
with my last heartbeat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The metaphor irritated Philip, because it assumed for the speaker a romantic
attitude and cast a slur upon the position which Philip instinctively felt had
more to say for it than he could think of at the moment.
</p>

<p>
But this evening Philip, undecided, wanted to talk about himself. Fortunately
it was late already and Cronshaw&rsquo;s pile of saucers on the table, each
indicating a drink, suggested that he was prepared to take an independent view
of things in general.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder if you&rsquo;d give me some advice,&rdquo; said Philip
suddenly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t take it, will you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip shrugged his shoulders impatiently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I shall ever do much good as a painter. I
don&rsquo;t see any use in being second-rate. I&rsquo;m thinking of chucking
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip hesitated for an instant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose I like the life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A change came over Cronshaw&rsquo;s placid, round face. The corners of the
mouth were suddenly depressed, the eyes sunk dully in their orbits; he seemed
to become strangely bowed and old.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This?&rdquo; he cried, looking round the cafe in which they sat. His
voice really trembled a little.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you can get out of it, do while there&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip stared at him with astonishment, but the sight of emotion always made
him feel shy, and he dropped his eyes. He knew that he was looking upon the
tragedy of failure. There was silence. Philip thought that Cronshaw was looking
upon his own life; and perhaps he considered his youth with its bright hopes
and the disappointments which wore out the radiancy; the wretched monotony of
pleasure, and the black future. Philip&rsquo;s eyes rested on the little pile
of saucers, and he knew that Cronshaw&rsquo;s were on them too.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>LI</h2>

<p>
Two months passed.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to Philip, brooding over these matters, that in the true painters,
writers, musicians, there was a power which drove them to such complete
absorption in their work as to make it inevitable for them to subordinate life
to art. Succumbing to an influence they never realised, they were merely dupes
of the instinct that possessed them, and life slipped through their fingers
unlived. But he had a feeling that life was to be lived rather than portrayed,
and he wanted to search out the various experiences of it and wring from each
moment all the emotion that it offered. He made up his mind at length to take a
certain step and abide by the result, and, having made up his mind, he
determined to take the step at once. Luckily enough the next morning was one of
Foinet&rsquo;s days, and he resolved to ask him point-blank whether it was
worth his while to go on with the study of art. He had never forgotten the
master&rsquo;s brutal advice to Fanny Price. It had been sound. Philip could
never get Fanny entirely out of his head. The studio seemed strange without
her, and now and then the gesture of one of the women working there or the tone
of a voice would give him a sudden start, reminding him of her: her presence
was more noticable now she was dead than it had ever been during her life; and
he often dreamed of her at night, waking with a cry of terror. It was horrible
to think of all the suffering she must have endured.
</p>

<p>
Philip knew that on the days Foinet came to the studio he lunched at a little
restaurant in the Rue d&rsquo;Odessa, and he hurried his own meal so that he
could go and wait outside till the painter came out. Philip walked up and down
the crowded street and at last saw Monsieur Foinet walking, with bent head,
towards him; Philip was very nervous, but he forced himself to go up to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pardon, monsieur, I should like to speak to you for one moment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Foinet gave him a rapid glance, recognised him, but did not smile a greeting.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been working here nearly two years now under you. I wanted to
ask you to tell me frankly if you think it worth while for me to
continue.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip&rsquo;s voice was trembling a little. Foinet walked on without looking
up. Philip, watching his face, saw no trace of expression upon it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very poor. If I have no talent I would sooner do something
else.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know if you have talent?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All my friends know they have talent, but I am aware some of them are
mistaken.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Foinet&rsquo;s bitter mouth outlined the shadow of a smile, and he asked:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you live near here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip told him where his studio was. Foinet turned round.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let us go there? You shall show me your work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now?&rdquo; cried Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip had nothing to say. He walked silently by the master&rsquo;s side. He
felt horribly sick. It had never struck him that Foinet would wish to see his
things there and then; he meant, so that he might have time to prepare himself,
to ask him if he would mind coming at some future date or whether he might
bring them to Foinet&rsquo;s studio. He was trembling with anxiety. In his
heart he hoped that Foinet would look at his picture, and that rare smile would
come into his face, and he would shake Philip&rsquo;s hand and say: &ldquo;Pas
mal. Go on, my lad. You have talent, real talent.&rdquo; Philip&rsquo;s heart
swelled at the thought. It was such a relief, such a joy! Now he could go on
with courage; and what did hardship matter, privation, and disappointment, if
he arrived at last? He had worked very hard, it would be too cruel if all that
industry were futile. And then with a start he remembered that he had heard
Fanny Price say just that. They arrived at the house, and Philip was seized
with fear. If he had dared he would have asked Foinet to go away. He did not
want to know the truth. They went in and the concierge handed him a letter as
they passed. He glanced at the envelope and recognised his uncle&rsquo;s
handwriting. Foinet followed him up the stairs. Philip could think of nothing
to say; Foinet was mute, and the silence got on his nerves. The professor sat
down; and Philip without a word placed before him the picture which the Salon
had rejected; Foinet nodded but did not speak; then Philip showed him the two
portraits he had made of Ruth Chalice, two or three landscapes which he had
painted at Moret, and a number of sketches.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; he said presently, with a nervous laugh.
</p>

<p>
Monsieur Foinet rolled himself a cigarette and lit it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have very little private means?&rdquo; he asked at last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very little,&rdquo; answered Philip, with a sudden feeling of cold at
his heart. &ldquo;Not enough to live on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is nothing so degrading as the constant anxiety about one&rsquo;s
means of livelihood. I have nothing but contempt for the people who despise
money. They are hypocrites or fools. Money is like a sixth sense without which
you cannot make a complete use of the other five. Without an adequate income
half the possibilities of life are shut off. The only thing to be careful about
is that you do not pay more than a shilling for the shilling you earn. You will
hear people say that poverty is the best spur to the artist. They have never
felt the iron of it in their flesh. They do not know how mean it makes you. It
exposes you to endless humiliation, it cuts your wings, it eats into your soul
like a cancer. It is not wealth one asks for, but just enough to preserve
one&rsquo;s dignity, to work unhampered, to be generous, frank, and
independent. I pity with all my heart the artist, whether he writes or paints,
who is entirely dependent for subsistence upon his art.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip quietly put away the various things which he had shown.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that sounds as if you didn&rsquo;t think I had much
chance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Monsieur Foinet slightly shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have a certain manual dexterity. With hard work and perseverance
there is no reason why you should not become a careful, not incompetent
painter. You would find hundreds who painted worse than you, hundreds who
painted as well. I see no talent in anything you have shown me. I see industry
and intelligence. You will never be anything but mediocre.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip obliged himself to answer quite steadily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very grateful to you for having taken so much trouble. I
can&rsquo;t thank you enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Monsieur Foinet got up and made as if to go, but he changed his mind and,
stopping, put his hand on Philip&rsquo;s shoulder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But if you were to ask me my advice, I should say: take your courage in
both hands and try your luck at something else. It sounds very hard, but let me
tell you this: I would give all I have in the world if someone had given me
that advice when I was your age and I had taken it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip looked up at him with surprise. The master forced his lips into a smile,
but his eyes remained grave and sad.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is cruel to discover one&rsquo;s mediocrity only when it is too late.
It does not improve the temper.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He gave a little laugh as he said the last words and quickly walked out of the
room.
</p>

<p>
Philip mechanically took up the letter from his uncle. The sight of his
handwriting made him anxious, for it was his aunt who always wrote to him. She
had been ill for the last three months, and he had offered to go over to
England and see her; but she, fearing it would interfere with his work, had
refused. She did not want him to put himself to inconvenience; she said she
would wait till August and then she hoped he would come and stay at the
vicarage for two or three weeks. If by any chance she grew worse she would let
him know, since she did not wish to die without seeing him again. If his uncle
wrote to him it must be because she was too ill to hold a pen. Philip opened
the letter. It ran as follows:
</p>

<p>
My dear Philip,
</p>

<p>
I regret to inform you that your dear Aunt departed this life early this
morning. She died very suddenly, but quite peacefully. The change for the worse
was so rapid that we had no time to send for you. She was fully prepared for
the end and entered into rest with the complete assurance of a blessed
resurrection and with resignation to the divine will of our blessed Lord Jesus
Christ. Your Aunt would have liked you to be present at the funeral so I trust
you will come as soon as you can. There is naturally a great deal of work
thrown upon my shoulders and I am very much upset. I trust that you will be
able to do everything for me. Your affectionate uncle,<br/>
William Carey.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>LII</h2>

<p>
Next day Philip arrived at Blackstable. Since the death of his mother he had
never lost anyone closely connected with him; his aunt&rsquo;s death shocked
him and filled him also with a curious fear; he felt for the first time his own
mortality. He could not realise what life would be for his uncle without the
constant companionship of the woman who had loved and tended him for forty
years. He expected to find him broken down with hopeless grief. He dreaded the
first meeting; he knew that he could say nothing which would be of use. He
rehearsed to himself a number of apposite speeches.
</p>

<p>
He entered the vicarage by the side-door and went into the dining-room. Uncle
William was reading the paper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your train was late,&rdquo; he said, looking up.
</p>

<p>
Philip was prepared to give way to his emotion, but the matter-of-fact
reception startled him. His uncle, subdued but calm, handed him the paper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a very nice little paragraph about her in The Blackstable
Times,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
Philip read it mechanically.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would you like to come up and see her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip nodded and together they walked upstairs. Aunt Louisa was lying in the
middle of the large bed, with flowers all round her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would you like to say a short prayer?&rdquo; said the Vicar.
</p>

<p>
He sank on his knees, and because it was expected of him Philip followed his
example. He looked at the little shrivelled face. He was only conscious of one
emotion: what a wasted life! In a minute Mr. Carey gave a cough, and stood up.
He pointed to a wreath at the foot of the bed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s from the Squire,&rdquo; he said. He spoke in a low voice as
though he were in church, but one felt that, as a clergyman, he found himself
quite at home. &ldquo;I expect tea is ready.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They went down again to the dining-room. The drawn blinds gave a lugubrious
aspect. The Vicar sat at the end of the table at which his wife had always sat
and poured out the tea with ceremony. Philip could not help feeling that
neither of them should have been able to eat anything, but when he saw that his
uncle&rsquo;s appetite was unimpaired he fell to with his usual heartiness.
They did not speak for a while. Philip set himself to eat an excellent cake
with the air of grief which he felt was decent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Things have changed a great deal since I was a curate,&rdquo; said the
Vicar presently. &ldquo;In my young days the mourners used always to be given a
pair of black gloves and a piece of black silk for their hats. Poor Louisa used
to make the silk into dresses. She always said that twelve funerals gave her a
new dress.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then he told Philip who had sent wreaths; there were twenty-four of them
already; when Mrs. Rawlingson, wife of the Vicar at Ferne, had died she had had
thirty-two; but probably a good many more would come the next day; the funeral
would start at eleven o&rsquo;clock from the vicarage, and they should beat
Mrs. Rawlingson easily. Louisa never liked Mrs. Rawlingson.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall take the funeral myself. I promised Louisa I would never let
anyone else bury her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip looked at his uncle with disapproval when he took a second piece of
cake. Under the circumstances he could not help thinking it greedy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mary Ann certainly makes capital cakes. I&rsquo;m afraid no one else
will make such good ones.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not going?&rdquo; cried Philip, with astonishment.
</p>

<p>
Mary Ann had been at the vicarage ever since he could remember. She never
forgot his birthday, but made a point always of sending him a trifle, absurd
but touching. He had a real affection for her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Mr. Carey. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it would do
to have a single woman in the house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, good heavens, she must be over forty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I think she is. But she&rsquo;s been rather troublesome lately,
she&rsquo;s been inclined to take too much on herself, and I thought this was a
very good opportunity to give her notice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly one which isn&rsquo;t likely to recur,&rdquo; said
Philip.
</p>

<p>
He took out a cigarette, but his uncle prevented him from lighting it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not till after the funeral, Philip,&rdquo; he said gently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be quite respectful to smoke in the house so long as
your poor Aunt Louisa is upstairs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Josiah Graves, churchwarden and manager of the bank, came back to dinner at the
vicarage after the funeral. The blinds had been drawn up, and Philip, against
his will, felt a curious sensation of relief. The body in the house had made
him uncomfortable: in life the poor woman had been all that was kind and
gentle; and yet, when she lay upstairs in her bed-room, cold and stark, it
seemed as though she cast upon the survivors a baleful influence. The thought
horrified Philip.
</p>

<p>
He found himself alone for a minute or two in the dining-room with the
churchwarden.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll be able to stay with your uncle a while,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he ought to be left alone just yet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t made any plans,&rdquo; answered Philip. &ldquo;If he
wants me I shall be very pleased to stay.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
By way of cheering the bereaved husband the churchwarden during dinner talked
of a recent fire at Blackstable which had partly destroyed the Wesleyan chapel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hear they weren&rsquo;t insured,&rdquo; he said, with a little smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t make any difference,&rdquo; said the Vicar.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll get as much money as they want to rebuild. Chapel people
are always ready to give money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see that Holden sent a wreath.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Holden was the dissenting minister, and, though for Christ&rsquo;s sake who
died for both of them, Mr. Carey nodded to him in the street, he did not speak
to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think it was very pushing,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;There were
forty-one wreaths. Yours was beautiful. Philip and I admired it very
much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it,&rdquo; said the banker.
</p>

<p>
He had noticed with satisfaction that it was larger than anyone&rsquo;s else.
It had looked very well. They began to discuss the people who attended the
funeral. Shops had been closed for it, and the churchwarden took out of his
pocket the notice which had been printed: &ldquo;Owing to the funeral of Mrs.
Carey this establishment will not be opened till one o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was my idea,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think it was very nice of them to close,&rdquo; said the Vicar.
&ldquo;Poor Louisa would have appreciated that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip ate his dinner. Mary Ann had treated the day as Sunday, and they had
roast chicken and a gooseberry tart.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you haven&rsquo;t thought about a tombstone yet?&rdquo; said
the churchwarden.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I have. I thought of a plain stone cross. Louisa was always against
ostentation.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think one can do much better than a cross. If you&rsquo;re
thinking of a text, what do you say to: With Christ, which is far
better?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Vicar pursed his lips. It was just like Bismarck to try and settle
everything himself. He did not like that text; it seemed to cast an aspersion
on himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I should put that. I much prefer: The Lord has given
and the Lord has taken away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, do you? That always seems to me a little indifferent.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Vicar answered with some acidity, and Mr. Graves replied in a tone which
the widower thought too authoritative for the occasion. Things were going
rather far if he could not choose his own text for his own wife&rsquo;s
tombstone. There was a pause, and then the conversation drifted to parish
matters. Philip went into the garden to smoke his pipe. He sat on a bench, and
suddenly began to laugh hysterically.
</p>

<p>
A few days later his uncle expressed the hope that he would spend the next few
weeks at Blackstable.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that will suit me very well,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;ll do if you go back to Paris in September.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip did not reply. He had thought much of what Foinet said to him, but he
was still so undecided that he did not wish to speak of the future. There would
be something fine in giving up art because he was convinced that he could not
excel; but unfortunately it would seem so only to himself: to others it would
be an admission of defeat, and he did not want to confess that he was beaten.
He was an obstinate fellow, and the suspicion that his talent did not lie in
one direction made him inclined to force circumstances and aim notwithstanding
precisely in that direction. He could not bear that his friends should laugh at
him. This might have prevented him from ever taking the definite step of
abandoning the study of painting, but the different environment made him on a
sudden see things differently. Like many another he discovered that crossing
the Channel makes things which had seemed important singularly futile. The life
which had been so charming that he could not bear to leave it now seemed inept;
he was seized with a distaste for the cafes, the restaurants with their
ill-cooked food, the shabby way in which they all lived. He did not care any
more what his friends thought about him: Cronshaw with his rhetoric, Mrs. Otter
with her respectability, Ruth Chalice with her affectations, Lawson and Clutton
with their quarrels; he felt a revulsion from them all. He wrote to Lawson and
asked him to send over all his belongings. A week later they arrived. When he
unpacked his canvases he found himself able to examine his work without
emotion. He noticed the fact with interest. His uncle was anxious to see his
pictures. Though he had so greatly disapproved of Philip&rsquo;s desire to go
to Paris, he accepted the situation now with equanimity. He was interested in
the life of students and constantly put Philip questions about it. He was in
fact a little proud of him because he was a painter, and when people were
present made attempts to draw him out. He looked eagerly at the studies of
models which Philip showed him. Philip set before him his portrait of Miguel
Ajuria.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why did you paint him?&rdquo; asked Mr. Carey.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I wanted a model, and his head interested me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As you haven&rsquo;t got anything to do here I wonder you don&rsquo;t
paint me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It would bore you to sit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I should like it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We must see about it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was amused at his uncle&rsquo;s vanity. It was clear that he was dying
to have his portrait painted. To get something for nothing was a chance not to
be missed. For two or three days he threw out little hints. He reproached
Philip for laziness, asked him when he was going to start work, and finally
began telling everyone he met that Philip was going to paint him. At last there
came a rainy day, and after breakfast Mr. Carey said to Philip:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, what d&rsquo;you say to starting on my portrait this
morning?&rdquo; Philip put down the book he was reading and leaned back in his
chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given up painting,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked his uncle in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s much object in being a second-rate
painter, and I came to the conclusion that I should never be anything
else.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You surprise me. Before you went to Paris you were quite certain that
you were a genius.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was mistaken,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should have thought now you&rsquo;d taken up a profession you&rsquo;d
have the pride to stick to it. It seems to me that what you lack is
perseverance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was a little annoyed that his uncle did not even see how truly heroic
his determination was.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;A rolling stone gathers no moss,&rsquo;&rdquo; proceeded the
clergyman. Philip hated that proverb above all, and it seemed to him perfectly
meaningless. His uncle had repeated it often during the arguments which had
preceded his departure from business. Apparently it recalled that occasion to
his guardian.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re no longer a boy, you know; you must begin to think of
settling down. First you insist on becoming a chartered accountant, and then
you get tired of that and you want to become a painter. And now if you please
you change your mind again. It points to…&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He hesitated for a moment to consider what defects of character exactly it
indicated, and Philip finished the sentence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Irresolution, incompetence, want of foresight, and lack of
determination.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Vicar looked up at his nephew quickly to see whether he was laughing at
him. Philip&rsquo;s face was serious, but there was a twinkle in his eyes which
irritated him. Philip should really be getting more serious. He felt it right
to give him a rap over the knuckles.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your money matters have nothing to do with me now. You&rsquo;re your own
master; but I think you should remember that your money won&rsquo;t last for
ever, and the unlucky deformity you have doesn&rsquo;t exactly make it easier
for you to earn your living.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip knew by now that whenever anyone was angry with him his first thought
was to say something about his club-foot. His estimate of the human race was
determined by the fact that scarcely anyone failed to resist the temptation.
But he had trained himself not to show any sign that the reminder wounded him.
He had even acquired control over the blushing which in his boyhood had been
one of his torments.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As you justly remark,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;my money matters have
nothing to do with you and I am my own master.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At all events you will do me the justice to acknowledge that I was
justified in my opposition when you made up your mind to become an
art-student.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know so much about that. I daresay one profits more by the
mistakes one makes off one&rsquo;s own bat than by doing the right thing on
somebody&rsquo;s else advice. I&rsquo;ve had my fling, and I don&rsquo;t mind
settling down now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What at?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was not prepared for the question, since in fact he had not made up his
mind. He had thought of a dozen callings.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The most suitable thing you could do is to enter your father&rsquo;s
profession and become a doctor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oddly enough that is precisely what I intend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had thought of doctoring among other things, chiefly because it was an
occupation which seemed to give a good deal of personal freedom, and his
experience of life in an office had made him determine never to have anything
more to do with one; his answer to the Vicar slipped out almost unawares,
because it was in the nature of a repartee. It amused him to make up his mind
in that accidental way, and he resolved then and there to enter his
father&rsquo;s old hospital in the autumn.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then your two years in Paris may be regarded as so much wasted
time?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. I had a very jolly two years, and I
learned one or two useful things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip reflected for an instant, and his answer was not devoid of a gentle
desire to annoy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I learned to look at hands, which I&rsquo;d never looked at before. And
instead of just looking at houses and trees I learned to look at houses and
trees against the sky. And I learned also that shadows are not black but
coloured.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you think you&rsquo;re very clever. I think your flippancy is
quite inane.&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>LIII</h2>

<p>
Taking the paper with him Mr. Carey retired to his study. Philip changed his
chair for that in which his uncle had been sitting (it was the only comfortable
one in the room), and looked out of the window at the pouring rain. Even in
that sad weather there was something restful about the green fields that
stretched to the horizon. There was an intimate charm in the landscape which he
did not remember ever to have noticed before. Two years in France had opened
his eyes to the beauty of his own countryside.
</p>

<p>
He thought with a smile of his uncle&rsquo;s remark. It was lucky that the turn
of his mind tended to flippancy. He had begun to realise what a great loss he
had sustained in the death of his father and mother. That was one of the
differences in his life which prevented him from seeing things in the same way
as other people. The love of parents for their children is the only emotion
which is quite disinterested. Among strangers he had grown up as best he could,
but he had seldom been used with patience or forbearance. He prided himself on
his self-control. It had been whipped into him by the mockery of his fellows.
Then they called him cynical and callous. He had acquired calmness of demeanour
and under most circumstances an unruffled exterior, so that now he could not
show his feelings. People told him he was unemotional; but he knew that he was
at the mercy of his emotions: an accidental kindness touched him so much that
sometimes he did not venture to speak in order not to betray the unsteadiness
of his voice. He remembered the bitterness of his life at school, the
humiliation which he had endured, the banter which had made him morbidly afraid
of making himself ridiculous; and he remembered the loneliness he had felt
since, faced with the world, the disillusion and the disappointment caused by
the difference between what it promised to his active imagination and what it
gave. But notwithstanding he was able to look at himself from the outside and
smile with amusement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove, if I weren&rsquo;t flippant, I should hang myself,&rdquo; he
thought cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
His mind went back to the answer he had given his uncle when he asked him what
he had learnt in Paris. He had learnt a good deal more than he told him. A
conversation with Cronshaw had stuck in his memory, and one phrase he had used,
a commonplace one enough, had set his brain working.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; Cronshaw said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no such thing
as abstract morality.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When Philip ceased to believe in Christianity he felt that a great weight was
taken from his shoulders; casting off the responsibility which weighed down
every action, when every action was infinitely important for the welfare of his
immortal soul, he experienced a vivid sense of liberty. But he knew now that
this was an illusion. When he put away the religion in which he had been
brought up, he had kept unimpaired the morality which was part and parcel of
it. He made up his mind therefore to think things out for himself. He
determined to be swayed by no prejudices. He swept away the virtues and the
vices, the established laws of good and evil, with the idea of finding out the
rules of life for himself. He did not know whether rules were necessary at all.
That was one of the things he wanted to discover. Clearly much that seemed
valid seemed so only because he had been taught it from his earliest youth. He
had read a number of books, but they did not help him much, for they were based
on the morality of Christianity; and even the writers who emphasised the fact
that they did not believe in it were never satisfied till they had framed a
system of ethics in accordance with that of the Sermon on the Mount. It seemed
hardly worth while to read a long volume in order to learn that you ought to
behave exactly like everybody else. Philip wanted to find out how he ought to
behave, and he thought he could prevent himself from being influenced by the
opinions that surrounded him. But meanwhile he had to go on living, and, until
he formed a theory of conduct, he made himself a provisional rule.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Follow your inclinations with due regard to the policeman round the
corner.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He thought the best thing he had gained in Paris was a complete liberty of
spirit, and he felt himself at last absolutely free. In a desultory way he had
read a good deal of philosophy, and he looked forward with delight to the
leisure of the next few months. He began to read at haphazard. He entered upon
each system with a little thrill of excitement, expecting to find in each some
guide by which he could rule his conduct; he felt himself like a traveller in
unknown countries and as he pushed forward the enterprise fascinated him; he
read emotionally, as other men read pure literature, and his heart leaped as he
discovered in noble words what himself had obscurely felt. His mind was
concrete and moved with difficulty in regions of the abstract; but, even when
he could not follow the reasoning, it gave him a curious pleasure to follow the
tortuosities of thoughts that threaded their nimble way on the edge of the
incomprehensible. Sometimes great philosophers seemed to have nothing to say to
him, but at others he recognised a mind with which he felt himself at home. He
was like the explorer in Central Africa who comes suddenly upon wide uplands,
with great trees in them and stretches of meadow, so that he might fancy
himself in an English park. He delighted in the robust common sense of Thomas
Hobbes; Spinoza filled him with awe, he had never before come in contact with a
mind so noble, so unapproachable and austere; it reminded him of that statue by
Rodin, L&rsquo;Age d&rsquo;Airain, which he passionately admired; and then
there was Hume: the scepticism of that charming philosopher touched a kindred
note in Philip; and, revelling in the lucid style which seemed able to put
complicated thought into simple words, musical and measured, he read as he
might have read a novel, a smile of pleasure on his lips. But in none could he
find exactly what he wanted. He had read somewhere that every man was born a
Platonist, an Aristotelian, a Stoic, or an Epicurean; and the history of George
Henry Lewes (besides telling you that philosophy was all moonshine) was there
to show that the thought of each philosopher was inseparably connected with the
man he was. When you knew that you could guess to a great extent the philosophy
he wrote. It looked as though you did not act in a certain way because you
thought in a certain way, but rather that you thought in a certain way because
you were made in a certain way. Truth had nothing to do with it. There was no
such thing as truth. Each man was his own philosopher, and the elaborate
systems which the great men of the past had composed were only valid for the
writers.
</p>

<p>
The thing then was to discover what one was and one&rsquo;s system of
philosophy would devise itself. It seemed to Philip that there were three
things to find out: man&rsquo;s relation to the world he lives in, man&rsquo;s
relation with the men among whom he lives, and finally man&rsquo;s relation to
himself. He made an elaborate plan of study.
</p>

<p>
The advantage of living abroad is that, coming in contact with the manners and
customs of the people among whom you live, you observe them from the outside
and see that they have not the necessity which those who practise them believe.
You cannot fail to discover that the beliefs which to you are self-evident to
the foreigner are absurd. The year in Germany, the long stay in Paris, had
prepared Philip to receive the sceptical teaching which came to him now with
such a feeling of relief. He saw that nothing was good and nothing was evil;
things were merely adapted to an end. He read The Origin of Species. It seemed
to offer an explanation of much that troubled him. He was like an explorer now
who has reasoned that certain natural features must present themselves, and,
beating up a broad river, finds here the tributary that he expected, there the
fertile, populated plains, and further on the mountains. When some great
discovery is made the world is surprised afterwards that it was not accepted at
once, and even on those who acknowledge its truth the effect is unimportant.
The first readers of The Origin of Species accepted it with their reason; but
their emotions, which are the ground of conduct, were untouched. Philip was
born a generation after this great book was published, and much that horrified
its contemporaries had passed into the feeling of the time, so that he was able
to accept it with a joyful heart. He was intensely moved by the grandeur of the
struggle for life, and the ethical rule which it suggested seemed to fit in
with his predispositions. He said to himself that might was right. Society
stood on one side, an organism with its own laws of growth and
self-preservation, while the individual stood on the other. The actions which
were to the advantage of society it termed virtuous and those which were not it
called vicious. Good and evil meant nothing more than that. Sin was a prejudice
from which the free man should rid himself. Society had three arms in its
contest with the individual, laws, public opinion, and conscience: the first
two could be met by guile, guile is the only weapon of the weak against the
strong: common opinion put the matter well when it stated that sin consisted in
being found out; but conscience was the traitor within the gates; it fought in
each heart the battle of society, and caused the individual to throw himself, a
wanton sacrifice, to the prosperity of his enemy. For it was clear that the two
were irreconcilable, the state and the individual conscious of himself. THAT
uses the individual for its own ends, trampling upon him if he thwarts it,
rewarding him with medals, pensions, honours, when he serves it faithfully;
THIS, strong only in his independence, threads his way through the state, for
convenience&rsquo; sake, paying in money or service for certain benefits, but
with no sense of obligation; and, indifferent to the rewards, asks only to be
left alone. He is the independent traveller, who uses Cook&rsquo;s tickets
because they save trouble, but looks with good-humoured contempt on the
personally conducted parties. The free man can do no wrong. He does everything
he likes&mdash;if he can. His power is the only measure of his morality. He
recognises the laws of the state and he can break them without sense of sin,
but if he is punished he accepts the punishment without rancour. Society has
the power.
</p>

<p>
But if for the individual there was no right and no wrong, then it seemed to
Philip that conscience lost its power. It was with a cry of triumph that he
seized the knave and flung him from his breast. But he was no nearer to the
meaning of life than he had been before. Why the world was there and what men
had come into existence for at all was as inexplicable as ever. Surely there
must be some reason. He thought of Cronshaw&rsquo;s parable of the Persian
carpet. He offered it as a solution of the riddle, and mysteriously he stated
that it was no answer at all unless you found it out for yourself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder what the devil he meant,&rdquo; Philip smiled.
</p>

<p>
And so, on the last day of September, eager to put into practice all these new
theories of life, Philip, with sixteen hundred pounds and his club-foot, set
out for the second time to London to make his third start in life.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">

<h2>LIV</h2>

<p>
The examination Philip had passed before he was articled to a chartered
accountant was sufficient qualification for him to enter a medical school. He
chose St. Luke&rsquo;s because his father had been a student there, and before
the end of the summer session had gone up to London for a day in order to see
the secretary. He got a list of rooms from him, and took lodgings in a dingy
house which had the advantage of being within two minutes&rsquo; walk of the
hospital.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to arrange about a part to dissect,&rdquo; the
secretary told him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better start on a leg; they generally
do; they seem to think it easier.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip found that his first lecture was in anatomy, at eleven, and about half
past ten he limped across the road, and a little nervously made his way to the
Medical School. Just inside the door a number of notices were pinned up, lists
of lectures, football fixtures, and the like; and these he looked at idly,
trying to seem at his ease. Young men and boys dribbled in and looked for
letters in the rack, chatted with one another, and passed downstairs to the
basement, in which was the student&rsquo;s reading-room. Philip saw several
fellows with a desultory, timid look dawdling around, and surmised that, like
himself, they were there for the first time. When he had exhausted the notices
he saw a glass door which led into what was apparently a museum, and having
still twenty minutes to spare he walked in. It was a collection of pathological
specimens. Presently a boy of about eighteen came up to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, are you first year?&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the lecture room, d&rsquo;you know? It&rsquo;s getting on
for eleven.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better try to find it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They walked out of the museum into a long, dark corridor, with the walls
painted in two shades of red, and other youths walking along suggested the way
to them. They came to a door marked Anatomy Theatre. Philip found that there
were a good many people already there. The seats were arranged in tiers, and
just as Philip entered an attendant came in, put a glass of water on the table
in the well of the lecture-room and then brought in a pelvis and two
thigh-bones, right and left. More men entered and took their seats and by
eleven the theatre was fairly full. There were about sixty students. For the
most part they were a good deal younger than Philip, smooth-faced boys of
eighteen, but there were a few who were older than he: he noticed one tall man,
with a fierce red moustache, who might have been thirty; another little fellow
with black hair, only a year or two younger; and there was one man with
spectacles and a beard which was quite gray.
</p>

<p>
The lecturer came in, Mr. Cameron, a handsome man with white hair and clean-cut
features. He called out the long list of names. Then he made a little speech.
He spoke in a pleasant voice, with well-chosen words, and he seemed to take a
discreet pleasure in their careful arrangement. He suggested one or two books
which they might buy and advised the purchase of a skeleton. He spoke of
anatomy with enthusiasm: it was essential to the study of surgery; a knowledge
of it added to the appreciation of art. Philip pricked up his ears. He heard
later that Mr. Cameron lectured also to the students at the Royal Academy. He
had lived many years in Japan, with a post at the University of Tokyo, and he
flattered himself on his appreciation of the beautiful.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will have to learn many tedious things,&rdquo; he finished, with an
indulgent smile, &ldquo;which you will forget the moment you have passed your
final examination, but in anatomy it is better to have learned and lost than
never to have learned at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He took up the pelvis which was lying on the table and began to describe it. He
spoke well and clearly.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the lecture the boy who had spoken to Philip in the pathological
museum and sat next to him in the theatre suggested that they should go to the
dissecting-room. Philip and he walked along the corridor again, and an
attendant told them where it was. As soon as they entered Philip understood
what the acrid smell was which he had noticed in the passage. He lit a pipe.
The attendant gave a short laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon get used to the smell. I don&rsquo;t notice it
myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He asked Philip&rsquo;s name and looked at a list on the board.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a leg&mdash;number four.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip saw that another name was bracketed with his own.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of that?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very short of bodies just now. We&rsquo;ve had to put two on
each part.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The dissecting-room was a large apartment painted like the corridors, the upper
part a rich salmon and the dado a dark terra-cotta. At regular intervals down
the long sides of the room, at right angles with the wall, were iron slabs,
grooved like meat-dishes; and on each lay a body. Most of them were men. They
were very dark from the preservative in which they had been kept, and the skin
had almost the look of leather. They were extremely emaciated. The attendant
took Philip up to one of the slabs. A youth was standing by it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is your name Carey?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, then we&rsquo;ve got this leg together. It&rsquo;s lucky it&rsquo;s
a man, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They generally always like a male better,&rdquo; said the attendant.
&ldquo;A female&rsquo;s liable to have a lot of fat about her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip looked at the body. The arms and legs were so thin that there was no
shape in them, and the ribs stood out so that the skin over them was tense. A
man of about forty-five with a thin, gray beard, and on his skull scanty,
colourless hair: the eyes were closed and the lower jaw sunken. Philip could
not feel that this had ever been a man, and yet in the row of them there was
something terrible and ghastly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d start at two,&rdquo; said the young man who was
dissecting with Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll be here then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had bought the day before the case of instruments which was needful, and now
he was given a locker. He looked at the boy who had accompanied him into the
dissecting-room and saw that he was white.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Make you feel rotten?&rdquo; Philip asked him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anyone dead before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They walked along the corridor till they came to the entrance of the school.
Philip remembered Fanny Price. She was the first dead person he had ever seen,
and he remembered how strangely it had affected him. There was an immeasurable
distance between the quick and the dead: they did not seem to belong to the
same species; and it was strange to think that but a little while before they
had spoken and moved and eaten and laughed. There was something horrible about
the dead, and you could imagine that they might cast an evil influence on the
living.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you say to having something to eat?&rdquo; said his new
friend to Philip.
</p>

<p>
They went down into the basement, where there was a dark room fitted up as a
restaurant, and here the students were able to get the same sort of fare as
they might have at an aerated bread shop. While they ate (Philip had a scone
and butter and a cup of chocolate), he discovered that his companion was called
Dunsford. He was a fresh-complexioned lad, with pleasant blue eyes and curly,
dark hair, large-limbed, slow of speech and movement. He had just come from
Clifton.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you taking the Conjoint?&rdquo; he asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I want to get qualified as soon as I can.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking it too, but I shall take the F. R. C. S. afterwards.
I&rsquo;m going in for surgery.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Most of the students took the curriculum of the Conjoint Board of the College
of Surgeons and the College of Physicians; but the more ambitious or the more
industrious added to this the longer studies which led to a degree from the
University of London. When Philip went to St. Luke&rsquo;s changes had recently
been made in the regulations, and the course took five years instead of four as
it had done for those who registered before the autumn of 1892. Dunsford was
well up in his plans and told Philip the usual course of events. The
&ldquo;first conjoint&rdquo; examination consisted of biology, anatomy, and
chemistry; but it could be taken in sections, and most fellows took their
biology three months after entering the school. This science had been recently
added to the list of subjects upon which the student was obliged to inform
himself, but the amount of knowledge required was very small.
</p>

<p>
When Philip went back to the dissecting-room, he was a few minutes late, since
he had forgotten to buy the loose sleeves which they wore to protect their
shirts, and he found a number of men already working. His partner had started
on the minute and was busy dissecting out cutaneous nerves. Two others were
engaged on the second leg, and more were occupied with the arms.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind my having started?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, fire away,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
He took the book, open at a diagram of the dissected part, and looked at what
they had to find.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re rather a dab at this,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve done a good deal of dissecting before, animals, you know,
for the Pre Sci.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a certain amount of conversation over the dissecting-table, partly
about the work, partly about the prospects of the football season, the
demonstrators, and the lectures. Philip felt himself a great deal older than
the others. They were raw schoolboys. But age is a matter of knowledge rather
than of years; and Newson, the active young man who was dissecting with him,
was very much at home with his subject. He was perhaps not sorry to show off,
and he explained very fully to Philip what he was about. Philip,
notwithstanding his hidden stores of wisdom, listened meekly. Then Philip took
up the scalpel and the tweezers and began working while the other looked on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ripping to have him so thin,&rdquo; said Newson, wiping his hands.
&ldquo;The blighter can&rsquo;t have had anything to eat for a month.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder what he died of,&rdquo; murmured Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know, any old thing, starvation chiefly, I suppose…. I
say, look out, don&rsquo;t cut that artery.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very fine to say, don&rsquo;t cut that artery,&rdquo;
remarked one of the men working on the opposite leg. &ldquo;Silly old
fool&rsquo;s got an artery in the wrong place.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Arteries always are in the wrong place,&rdquo; said Newson. &ldquo;The
normal&rsquo;s the one thing you practically never get. That&rsquo;s why
it&rsquo;s called the normal.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say things like that,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;or I shall
cut myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you cut yourself,&rdquo; answered Newson, full of information,
&ldquo;wash it at once with antiseptic. It&rsquo;s the one thing you&rsquo;ve
got to be careful about. There was a chap here last year who gave himself only
a prick, and he didn&rsquo;t bother about it, and he got septicaemia.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did he get all right?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, no, he died in a week. I went and had a look at him in the P. M.
room.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip&rsquo;s back ached by the time it was proper to have tea, and his
luncheon had been so light that he was quite ready for it. His hands smelt of
that peculiar odour which he had first noticed that morning in the corridor. He
thought his muffin tasted of it too.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll get used to that,&rdquo; said Newson. &ldquo;When you
don&rsquo;t have the good old dissecting-room stink about, you feel quite
lonely.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to let it spoil my appetite,&rdquo; said Philip, as
he followed up the muffin with a piece of cake.

<h2>LV</h2>

<p>
Philip&rsquo;s ideas of the life of medical students, like those of the public
at large, were founded on the pictures which Charles Dickens drew in the middle
of the nineteenth century. He soon discovered that Bob Sawyer, if he ever
existed, was no longer at all like the medical student of the present.
</p>

<p>
It is a mixed lot which enters upon the medical profession, and naturally there
are some who are lazy and reckless. They think it is an easy life, idle away a
couple of years; and then, because their funds come to an end or because angry
parents refuse any longer to support them, drift away from the hospital. Others
find the examinations too hard for them; one failure after another robs them of
their nerve; and, panic-stricken, they forget as soon as they come into the
forbidding buildings of the Conjoint Board the knowledge which before they had
so pat. They remain year after year, objects of good-humoured scorn to younger
men: some of them crawl through the examination of the Apothecaries Hall;
others become non-qualified assistants, a precarious position in which they are
at the mercy of their employer; their lot is poverty, drunkenness, and Heaven
only knows their end. But for the most part medical students are industrious
young men of the middle-class with a sufficient allowance to live in the
respectable fashion they have been used to; many are the sons of doctors who
have already something of the professional manner; their career is mapped out:
as soon as they are qualified they propose to apply for a hospital appointment,
after holding which (and perhaps a trip to the Far East as a ship&rsquo;s
doctor), they will join their father and spend the rest of their days in a
country practice. One or two are marked out as exceptionally brilliant: they
will take the various prizes and scholarships which are open each year to the
deserving, get one appointment after another at the hospital, go on the staff,
take a consulting-room in Harley Street, and, specialising in one subject or
another, become prosperous, eminent, and titled.
</p>

<p>
The medical profession is the only one which a man may enter at any age with
some chance of making a living. Among the men of Philip&rsquo;s year were three
or four who were past their first youth: one had been in the Navy, from which
according to report he had been dismissed for drunkenness; he was a man of
thirty, with a red face, a brusque manner, and a loud voice. Another was a
married man with two children, who had lost money through a defaulting
solicitor; he had a bowed look as if the world were too much for him; he went
about his work silently, and it was plain that he found it difficult at his age
to commit facts to memory. His mind worked slowly. His effort at application
was painful to see.
</p>

<p>
Philip made himself at home in his tiny rooms. He arranged his books and hung
on the walls such pictures and sketches as he possessed. Above him, on the
drawing-room floor, lived a fifth-year man called Griffiths; but Philip saw
little of him, partly because he was occupied chiefly in the wards and partly
because he had been to Oxford. Such of the students as had been to a university
kept a good deal together: they used a variety of means natural to the young in
order to impress upon the less fortunate a proper sense of their inferiority;
the rest of the students found their Olympian serenity rather hard to bear.
Griffiths was a tall fellow, with a quantity of curly red hair and blue eyes, a
white skin and a very red mouth; he was one of those fortunate people whom
everybody liked, for he had high spirits and a constant gaiety. He strummed a
little on the piano and sang comic songs with gusto; and evening after evening,
while Philip was reading in his solitary room, he heard the shouts and the
uproarious laughter of Griffiths&rsquo; friends above him. He thought of those
delightful evenings in Paris when they would sit in the studio, Lawson and he,
Flanagan and Clutton, and talk of art and morals, the love-affairs of the
present, and the fame of the future. He felt sick at heart. He found that it
was easy to make a heroic gesture, but hard to abide by its results. The worst
of it was that the work seemed to him very tedious. He had got out of the habit
of being asked questions by demonstrators. His attention wandered at lectures.
Anatomy was a dreary science, a mere matter of learning by heart an enormous
number of facts; dissection bored him; he did not see the use of dissecting out
laboriously nerves and arteries when with much less trouble you could see in
the diagrams of a book or in the specimens of the pathological museum exactly
where they were.
</p>

<p>
He made friends by chance, but not intimate friends, for he seemed to have
nothing in particular to say to his companions. When he tried to interest
himself in their concerns, he felt that they found him patronising. He was not
of those who can talk of what moves them without caring whether it bores or not
the people they talk to. One man, hearing that he had studied art in Paris, and
fancying himself on his taste, tried to discuss art with him; but Philip was
impatient of views which did not agree with his own; and, finding quickly that
the other&rsquo;s ideas were conventional, grew monosyllabic. Philip desired
popularity but could bring himself to make no advances to others. A fear of
rebuff prevented him from affability, and he concealed his shyness, which was
still intense, under a frigid taciturnity. He was going through the same
experience as he had done at school, but here the freedom of the medical
students&rsquo; life made it possible for him to live a good deal by himself.
</p>

<p>
It was through no effort of his that he became friendly with Dunsford, the
fresh-complexioned, heavy lad whose acquaintance he had made at the beginning
of the session. Dunsford attached himself to Philip merely because he was the
first person he had known at St. Luke&rsquo;s. He had no friends in London, and
on Saturday nights he and Philip got into the habit of going together to the
pit of a music-hall or the gallery of a theatre. He was stupid, but he was
good-humoured and never took offence; he always said the obvious thing, but
when Philip laughed at him merely smiled. He had a very sweet smile. Though
Philip made him his butt, he liked him; he was amused by his candour and
delighted with his agreeable nature: Dunsford had the charm which himself was
acutely conscious of not possessing.
</p>

<p>
They often went to have tea at a shop in Parliament Street, because Dunsford
admired one of the young women who waited. Philip did not find anything
attractive in her. She was tall and thin, with narrow hips and the chest of a
boy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No one would look at her in Paris,&rdquo; said Philip scornfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a ripping face,&rdquo; said Dunsford.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What DOES the face matter?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She had the small regular features, the blue eyes, and the broad low brow,
which the Victorian painters, Lord Leighton, Alma Tadema, and a hundred others,
induced the world they lived in to accept as a type of Greek beauty. She seemed
to have a great deal of hair: it was arranged with peculiar elaboration and
done over the forehead in what she called an Alexandra fringe. She was very
anaemic. Her thin lips were pale, and her skin was delicate, of a faint green
colour, without a touch of red even in the cheeks. She had very good teeth. She
took great pains to prevent her work from spoiling her hands, and they were
small, thin, and white. She went about her duties with a bored look.
</p>

<p>
Dunsford, very shy with women, had never succeeded in getting into conversation
with her; and he urged Philip to help him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All I want is a lead,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and then I can manage for
myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip, to please him, made one or two remarks, but she answered with
monosyllables. She had taken their measure. They were boys, and she surmised
they were students. She had no use for them. Dunsford noticed that a man with
sandy hair and a bristly moustache, who looked like a German, was favoured with
her attention whenever he came into the shop; and then it was only by calling
her two or three times that they could induce her to take their order. She used
the clients whom she did not know with frigid insolence, and when she was
talking to a friend was perfectly indifferent to the calls of the hurried. She
had the art of treating women who desired refreshment with just that degree of
impertinence which irritated them without affording them an opportunity of
complaining to the management. One day Dunsford told him her name was Mildred.
He had heard one of the other girls in the shop address her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What an odious name,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Dunsford.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I like it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so pretentious.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It chanced that on this day the German was not there, and, when she brought the
tea, Philip, smiling, remarked:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your friend&rsquo;s not here today.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; she said coldly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was referring to the nobleman with the sandy moustache. Has he left
you for another?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Some people would do better to mind their own business,&rdquo; she
retorted.
</p>

<p>
She left them, and, since for a minute or two there was no one to attend to,
sat down and looked at the evening paper which a customer had left behind him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are a fool to put her back up,&rdquo; said Dunsford.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really quite indifferent to the attitude of her
vertebrae,&rdquo; replied Philip.
</p>

<p>
But he was piqued. It irritated him that when he tried to be agreeable with a
woman she should take offence. When he asked for the bill, he hazarded a remark
which he meant to lead further.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are we no longer on speaking terms?&rdquo; he smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to take orders and to wait on customers. I&rsquo;ve got
nothing to say to them, and I don&rsquo;t want them to say anything to
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She put down the slip of paper on which she had marked the sum they had to pay,
and walked back to the table at which she had been sitting. Philip flushed with
anger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one in the eye for you, Carey,&rdquo; said Dunsford, when
they got outside.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ill-mannered slut,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t go there
again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His influence with Dunsford was strong enough to get him to take their tea
elsewhere, and Dunsford soon found another young woman to flirt with. But the
snub which the waitress had inflicted on him rankled. If she had treated him
with civility he would have been perfectly indifferent to her; but it was
obvious that she disliked him rather than otherwise, and his pride was wounded.
He could not suppress a desire to be even with her. He was impatient with
himself because he had so petty a feeling, but three or four days&rsquo;
firmness, during which he would not go to the shop, did not help him to
surmount it; and he came to the conclusion that it would be least trouble to
see her. Having done so he would certainly cease to think of her. Pretexting an
appointment one afternoon, for he was not a little ashamed of his weakness, he
left Dunsford and went straight to the shop which he had vowed never again to
enter. He saw the waitress the moment he came in and sat down at one of her
tables. He expected her to make some reference to the fact that he had not been
there for a week, but when she came up for his order she said nothing. He had
heard her say to other customers:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite a stranger.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She gave no sign that she had ever seen him before. In order to see whether she
had really forgotten him, when she brought his tea, he asked:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you seen my friend tonight?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s not been in here for some days.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He wanted to use this as the beginning of a conversation, but he was strangely
nervous and could think of nothing to say. She gave him no opportunity, but at
once went away. He had no chance of saying anything till he asked for his bill.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Filthy weather, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
It was mortifying that he had been forced to prepare such a phrase as that. He
could not make out why she filled him with such embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t make much difference to me what the weather is, having to
be in here all day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was an insolence in her tone that peculiarly irritated him. A sarcasm
rose to his lips, but he forced himself to be silent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish to God she&rsquo;d say something really cheeky,&rdquo; he raged
to himself, &ldquo;so that I could report her and get her sacked. It would
serve her damned well right.&rdquo;
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">

<h2>LVI</h2>

<p>
He could not get her out of his mind. He laughed angrily at his own
foolishness: it was absurd to care what an anaemic little waitress said to him;
but he was strangely humiliated. Though no one knew of the humiliation but
Dunsford, and he had certainly forgotten, Philip felt that he could have no
peace till he had wiped it out. He thought over what he had better do. He made
up his mind that he would go to the shop every day; it was obvious that he had
made a disagreeable impression on her, but he thought he had the wits to
eradicate it; he would take care not to say anything at which the most
susceptible person could be offended. All this he did, but it had no effect.
When he went in and said good-evening she answered with the same words, but
when once he omitted to say it in order to see whether she would say it first,
she said nothing at all. He murmured in his heart an expression which though
frequently applicable to members of the female sex is not often used of them in
polite society; but with an unmoved face he ordered his tea. He made up his
mind not to speak a word, and left the shop without his usual good-night. He
promised himself that he would not go any more, but the next day at tea-time he
grew restless. He tried to think of other things, but he had no command over
his thoughts. At last he said desperately:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;After all there&rsquo;s no reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t go if I want
to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The struggle with himself had taken a long time, and it was getting on for
seven when he entered the shop.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought you weren&rsquo;t coming,&rdquo; the girl said to him, when he
sat down.
</p>

<p>
His heart leaped in his bosom and he felt himself reddening. &ldquo;I was
detained. I couldn&rsquo;t come before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Cutting up people, I suppose?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not so bad as that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are a stoodent, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But that seemed to satisfy her curiosity. She went away and, since at that late
hour there was nobody else at her tables, she immersed herself in a novelette.
This was before the time of the sixpenny reprints. There was a regular supply
of inexpensive fiction written to order by poor hacks for the consumption of
the illiterate. Philip was elated; she had addressed him of her own accord; he
saw the time approaching when his turn would come and he would tell her exactly
what he thought of her. It would be a great comfort to express the immensity of
his contempt. He looked at her. It was true that her profile was beautiful; it
was extraordinary how English girls of that class had so often a perfection of
outline which took your breath away, but it was as cold as marble; and the
faint green of her delicate skin gave an impression of unhealthiness. All the
waitresses were dressed alike, in plain black dresses, with a white apron,
cuffs, and a small cap. On a half sheet of paper that he had in his pocket
Philip made a sketch of her as she sat leaning over her book (she outlined the
words with her lips as she read), and left it on the table when he went away.
It was an inspiration, for next day, when he came in, she smiled at him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you could draw,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was an art-student in Paris for two years.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I showed that drawing you left be&rsquo;ind you last night to the
manageress and she WAS struck with it. Was it meant to be me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
When she went for his tea, one of the other girls came up to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I saw that picture you done of Miss Rogers. It was the very image of
her,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
That was the first time he had heard her name, and when he wanted his bill he
called her by it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see you know my name,&rdquo; she said, when she came.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your friend mentioned it when she said something to me about that
drawing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She wants you to do one of her. Don&rsquo;t you do it. If you once begin
you&rsquo;ll have to go on, and they&rsquo;ll all be wanting you to do
them.&rdquo; Then without a pause, with peculiar inconsequence, she said:
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that young fellow that used to come with you? Has he gone
away?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fancy your remembering him,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He was a nice-looking young fellow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip felt quite a peculiar sensation in his heart. He did not know what it
was. Dunsford had jolly curling hair, a fresh complexion, and a beautiful
smile. Philip thought of these advantages with envy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s in love,&rdquo; said he, with a little laugh.
</p>

<p>
Philip repeated every word of the conversation to himself as he limped home.
She was quite friendly with him now. When opportunity arose he would offer to
make a more finished sketch of her, he was sure she would like that; her face
was interesting, the profile was lovely, and there was something curiously
fascinating about the chlorotic colour. He tried to think what it was like; at
first he thought of pea soup; but, driving away that idea angrily, he thought
of the petals of a yellow rosebud when you tore it to pieces before it had
burst. He had no ill-feeling towards her now.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not a bad sort,&rdquo; he murmured.
</p>

<p>
It was silly of him to take offence at what she had said; it was doubtless his
own fault; she had not meant to make herself disagreeable: he ought to be
accustomed by now to making at first sight a bad impression on people. He was
flattered at the success of his drawing; she looked upon him with more interest
now that she was aware of this small talent. He was restless next day. He
thought of going to lunch at the tea-shop, but he was certain there would be
many people there then, and Mildred would not be able to talk to him. He had
managed before this to get out of having tea with Dunsford, and, punctually at
half past four (he had looked at his watch a dozen times), he went into the
shop.
</p>

<p>
Mildred had her back turned to him. She was sitting down, talking to the German
whom Philip had seen there every day till a fortnight ago and since then had
not seen at all. She was laughing at what he said. Philip thought she had a
common laugh, and it made him shudder. He called her, but she took no notice;
he called her again; then, growing angry, for he was impatient, he rapped the
table loudly with his stick. She approached sulkily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How d&rsquo;you do?&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You seem to be in a great hurry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked down at him with the insolent manner which he knew so well.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll kindly give your order I&rsquo;ll get what you want. I
can&rsquo;t stand talking all night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tea and toasted bun, please,&rdquo; Philip answered briefly.
</p>

<p>
He was furious with her. He had The Star with him and read it elaborately when
she brought the tea.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll give me my bill now I needn&rsquo;t trouble you
again,&rdquo; he said icily.
</p>

<p>
She wrote out the slip, placed it on the table, and went back to the German.
Soon she was talking to him with animation. He was a man of middle height, with
the round head of his nation and a sallow face; his moustache was large and
bristling; he had on a tail-coat and gray trousers, and he wore a massive gold
watch-chain. Philip thought the other girls looked from him to the pair at the
table and exchanged significant glances. He felt certain they were laughing at
him, and his blood boiled. He detested Mildred now with all his heart. He knew
that the best thing he could do was to cease coming to the tea-shop, but he
could not bear to think that he had been worsted in the affair, and he devised
a plan to show her that he despised her. Next day he sat down at another table
and ordered his tea from another waitress. Mildred&rsquo;s friend was there
again and she was talking to him. She paid no attention to Philip, and so when
he went out he chose a moment when she had to cross his path: as he passed he
looked at her as though he had never seen her before. He repeated this for
three or four days. He expected that presently she would take the opportunity
to say something to him; he thought she would ask why he never came to one of
her tables now, and he had prepared an answer charged with all the loathing he
felt for her. He knew it was absurd to trouble, but he could not help himself.
She had beaten him again. The German suddenly disappeared, but Philip still sat
at other tables. She paid no attention to him. Suddenly he realised that what
he did was a matter of complete indifference to her; he could go on in that way
till doomsday, and it would have no effect.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not finished yet,&rdquo; he said to himself.
</p>

<p>
The day after he sat down in his old seat, and when she came up said
good-evening as though he had not ignored her for a week. His face was placid,
but he could not prevent the mad beating of his heart. At that time the musical
comedy had lately leaped into public favour, and he was sure that Mildred would
be delighted to go to one.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he said suddenly, &ldquo;I wonder if you&rsquo;d dine with
me one night and come to The Belle of New York. I&rsquo;ll get a couple of
stalls.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He added the last sentence in order to tempt her. He knew that when the girls
went to the play it was either in the pit, or, if some man took them, seldom to
more expensive seats than the upper circle. Mildred&rsquo;s pale face showed no
change of expression.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When will you come?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I get off early on Thursdays.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They made arrangements. Mildred lived with an aunt at Herne Hill. The play
began at eight so they must dine at seven. She proposed that he should meet her
in the second-class waiting-room at Victoria Station. She showed no pleasure,
but accepted the invitation as though she conferred a favour. Philip was
vaguely irritated.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>LVII</h2>

<p>
Philip arrived at Victoria Station nearly half an hour before the time which
Mildred had appointed, and sat down in the second-class waiting-room. He waited
and she did not come. He began to grow anxious, and walked into the station
watching the incoming suburban trains; the hour which she had fixed passed, and
still there was no sign of her. Philip was impatient. He went into the other
waiting-rooms and looked at the people sitting in them. Suddenly his heart gave
a great thud.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There you are. I thought you were never coming.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I like that after keeping me waiting all this time. I had half a mind to
go back home again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you said you&rsquo;d come to the second-class waiting-room.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say any such thing. It isn&rsquo;t exactly likely
I&rsquo;d sit in the second-class room when I could sit in the first is
it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Though Philip was sure he had not made a mistake, he said nothing, and they got
into a cab.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where are we dining?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought of the Adelphi Restaurant. Will that suit you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind where we dine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She spoke ungraciously. She was put out by being kept waiting and answered
Philip&rsquo;s attempt at conversation with monosyllables. She wore a long
cloak of some rough, dark material and a crochet shawl over her head. They
reached the restaurant and sat down at a table. She looked round with
satisfaction. The red shades to the candles on the tables, the gold of the
decorations, the looking-glasses, lent the room a sumptuous air.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been here before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She gave Philip a smile. She had taken off her cloak; and he saw that she wore
a pale blue dress, cut square at the neck; and her hair was more elaborately
arranged than ever. He had ordered champagne and when it came her eyes
sparkled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are going it,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve ordered fiz?&rdquo; he asked carelessly, as though he
never drank anything else.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I WAS surprised when you asked me to do a theatre with you.&rdquo;
Conversation did not go very easily, for she did not seem to have much to say;
and Philip was nervously conscious that he was not amusing her. She listened
carelessly to his remarks, with her eyes on other diners, and made no pretence
that she was interested in him. He made one or two little jokes, but she took
them quite seriously. The only sign of vivacity he got was when he spoke of the
other girls in the shop; she could not bear the manageress and told him all her
misdeeds at length.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stick her at any price and all the air she gives herself.
Sometimes I&rsquo;ve got more than half a mind to tell her something she
doesn&rsquo;t think I know anything about.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I happen to know that she&rsquo;s not above going to Eastbourne
with a man for the week-end now and again. One of the girls has a married
sister who goes there with her husband, and she&rsquo;s seen her. She was
staying at the same boarding-house, and she &rsquo;ad a wedding-ring on, and I
know for one she&rsquo;s not married.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip filled her glass, hoping that champagne would make her more affable; he
was anxious that his little jaunt should be a success. He noticed that she held
her knife as though it were a pen-holder, and when she drank protruded her
little finger. He started several topics of conversation, but he could get
little out of her, and he remembered with irritation that he had seen her
talking nineteen to the dozen and laughing with the German. They finished
dinner and went to the play. Philip was a very cultured young man, and he
looked upon musical comedy with scorn. He thought the jokes vulgar and the
melodies obvious; it seemed to him that they did these things much better in
France; but Mildred enjoyed herself thoroughly; she laughed till her sides
ached, looking at Philip now and then when something tickled her to exchange a
glance of pleasure; and she applauded rapturously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is the seventh time I&rsquo;ve been,&rdquo; she said, after the
first act, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t mind if I come seven times more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She was much interested in the women who surrounded them in the stalls. She
pointed out to Philip those who were painted and those who wore false hair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is horrible, these West-end people,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know how they can do it.&rdquo; She put her hand to her hair.
&ldquo;Mine&rsquo;s all my own, every bit of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She found no one to admire, and whenever she spoke of anyone it was to say
something disagreeable. It made Philip uneasy. He supposed that next day she
would tell the girls in the shop that he had taken her out and that he had
bored her to death. He disliked her, and yet, he knew not why, he wanted to be
with her. On the way home he asked:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed yourself?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rather.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you come out with me again one evening?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He could never get beyond such expressions as that. Her indifference maddened
him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That sounds as if you didn&rsquo;t much care if you came or not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, if you don&rsquo;t take me out some other fellow will. I need never
want for men who&rsquo;ll take me to the theatre.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was silent. They came to the station, and he went to the booking-office.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my season,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d take you home as it&rsquo;s rather late, if you
don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind if it gives you any pleasure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He took a single first for her and a return for himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re not mean, I will say that for you,&rdquo; she said,
when he opened the carriage-door.
</p>

<p>
Philip did not know whether he was pleased or sorry when other people entered
and it was impossible to speak. They got out at Herne Hill, and he accompanied
her to the corner of the road in which she lived.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say good-night to you here,&rdquo; she said, holding out her
hand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not come up to the door. I know what people
are, and I don&rsquo;t want to have anybody talking.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She said good-night and walked quickly away. He could see the white shawl in
the darkness. He thought she might turn round, but she did not. Philip saw
which house she went into, and in a moment he walked along to look at it. It
was a trim, common little house of yellow brick, exactly like all the other
little houses in the street. He stood outside for a few minutes, and presently
the window on the top floor was darkened. Philip strolled slowly back to the
station. The evening had been unsatisfactory. He felt irritated, restless, and
miserable.
</p>

<p>
When he lay in bed he seemed still to see her sitting in the corner of the
railway carriage, with the white crochet shawl over her head. He did not know
how he was to get through the hours that must pass before his eyes rested on
her again. He thought drowsily of her thin face, with its delicate features,
and the greenish pallor of her skin. He was not happy with her, but he was
unhappy away from her. He wanted to sit by her side and look at her, he wanted
to touch her, he wanted… the thought came to him and he did not finish it,
suddenly he grew wide awake… he wanted to kiss the thin, pale mouth with its
narrow lips. The truth came to him at last. He was in love with her. It was
incredible.
</p>

<p>
He had often thought of falling in love, and there was one scene which he had
pictured to himself over and over again. He saw himself coming into a
ball-room; his eyes fell on a little group of men and women talking; and one of
the women turned round. Her eyes fell upon him, and he knew that the gasp in
his throat was in her throat too. He stood quite still. She was tall and dark
and beautiful with eyes like the night; she was dressed in white, and in her
black hair shone diamonds; they stared at one another, forgetting that people
surrounded them. He went straight up to her, and she moved a little towards
him. Both felt that the formality of introduction was out of place. He spoke to
her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking for you all my life,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come at last,&rdquo; she murmured.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you dance with me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She surrendered herself to his outstretched hands and they danced. (Philip
always pretended that he was not lame.) She danced divinely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never danced with anyone who danced like you,&rdquo; she
said.
</p>

<p>
She tore up her programme, and they danced together the whole evening.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so thankful that I waited for you,&rdquo; he said to her.
&ldquo;I knew that in the end I must meet you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
People in the ball-room stared. They did not care. They did not wish to hide
their passion. At last they went into the garden. He flung a light cloak over
her shoulders and put her in a waiting cab. They caught the midnight train to
Paris; and they sped through the silent, star-lit night into the unknown.
</p>

<p>
He thought of this old fancy of his, and it seemed impossible that he should be
in love with Mildred Rogers. Her name was grotesque. He did not think her
pretty; he hated the thinness of her, only that evening he had noticed how the
bones of her chest stood out in evening-dress; he went over her features one by
one; he did not like her mouth, and the unhealthiness of her colour vaguely
repelled him. She was common. Her phrases, so bald and few, constantly
repeated, showed the emptiness of her mind; he recalled her vulgar little laugh
at the jokes of the musical comedy; and he remembered the little finger
carefully extended when she held her glass to her mouth; her manners like her
conversation, were odiously genteel. He remembered her insolence; sometimes he
had felt inclined to box her ears; and suddenly, he knew not why, perhaps it
was the thought of hitting her or the recollection of her tiny, beautiful ears,
he was seized by an uprush of emotion. He yearned for her. He thought of taking
her in his arms, the thin, fragile body, and kissing her pale mouth: he wanted
to pass his fingers down the slightly greenish cheeks. He wanted her.
</p>

<p>
He had thought of love as a rapture which seized one so that all the world
seemed spring-like, he had looked forward to an ecstatic happiness; but this
was not happiness; it was a hunger of the soul, it was a painful yearning, it
was a bitter anguish, he had never known before. He tried to think when it had
first come to him. He did not know. He only remembered that each time he had
gone into the shop, after the first two or three times, it had been with a
little feeling in the heart that was pain; and he remembered that when she
spoke to him he felt curiously breathless. When she left him it was
wretchedness, and when she came to him again it was despair.
</p>

<p>
He stretched himself in his bed as a dog stretches himself. He wondered how he
was going to endure that ceaseless aching of his soul.
</p>

<h2>LVIII</h2>

<p>
Philip woke early next morning, and his first thought was of Mildred. It struck
him that he might meet her at Victoria Station and walk with her to the shop.
He shaved quickly, scrambled into his clothes, and took a bus to the station.
He was there by twenty to eight and watched the incoming trains. Crowds poured
out of them, clerks and shop-people at that early hour, and thronged up the
platform: they hurried along, sometimes in pairs, here and there a group of
girls, but more often alone. They were white, most of them, ugly in the early
morning, and they had an abstracted look; the younger ones walked lightly, as
though the cement of the platform were pleasant to tread, but the others went
as though impelled by a machine: their faces were set in an anxious frown.
</p>

<p>
At last Philip saw Mildred, and he went up to her eagerly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d come and see
how you were after last night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She wore an old brown ulster and a sailor hat. It was very clear that she was
not pleased to see him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all right. I haven&rsquo;t got much time to waste.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you mind if I walk down Victoria Street with you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m none too early. I shall have to walk fast,&rdquo; she
answered, looking down at Philip&rsquo;s club-foot.
</p>

<p>
He turned scarlet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I beg your pardon. I won&rsquo;t detain you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can please yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She went on, and he with a sinking heart made his way home to breakfast. He
hated her. He knew he was a fool to bother about her; she was not the sort of
woman who would ever care two straws for him, and she must look upon his
deformity with distaste. He made up his mind that he would not go in to tea
that afternoon, but, hating himself, he went. She nodded to him as he came in
and smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I expect I was rather short with you this morning,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You see, I didn&rsquo;t expect you, and it came like a surprise.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t matter at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He felt that a great weight had suddenly been lifted from him. He was
infinitely grateful for one word of kindness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you sit down?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s
wanting you just now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind if I do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked at her, but could think of nothing to say; he racked his brains
anxiously, seeking for a remark which should keep her by him; he wanted to tell
her how much she meant to him; but he did not know how to make love now that he
loved in earnest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your friend with the fair moustache? I haven&rsquo;t seen
him lately.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s gone back to Birmingham. He&rsquo;s in business there. He
only comes up to London every now and again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is he in love with you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better ask him,&rdquo; she said, with a laugh. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s got to do with you if he is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A bitter answer leaped to his tongue, but he was learning self-restraint.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder why you say things like that,&rdquo; was all he permitted
himself to say.
</p>

<p>
She looked at him with those indifferent eyes of hers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It looks as if you didn&rsquo;t set much store on me,&rdquo; he added.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No reason at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He reached over for his paper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are quick-tempered,&rdquo; she said, when she saw the gesture.
&ldquo;You do take offence easily.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He smiled and looked at her appealingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you do something for me?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That depends what it is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me walk back to the station with you tonight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He went out after tea and went back to his rooms, but at eight o&rsquo;clock,
when the shop closed, he was waiting outside.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are a caution,&rdquo; she said, when she came out. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought it was very difficult,&rdquo; he answered
bitterly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did any of the girls see you waiting for me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know and I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They all laugh at you, you know. They say you&rsquo;re spoony on
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Much you care,&rdquo; he muttered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now then, quarrelsome.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At the station he took a ticket and said he was going to accompany her home.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to have much to do with your time,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose I can waste it in my own way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They seemed to be always on the verge of a quarrel. The fact was that he hated
himself for loving her. She seemed to be constantly humiliating him, and for
each snub that he endured he owed her a grudge. But she was in a friendly mood
that evening, and talkative: she told him that her parents were dead; she gave
him to understand that she did not have to earn her living, but worked for
amusement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My aunt doesn&rsquo;t like my going to business. I can have the best of
everything at home. I don&rsquo;t want you to think I work because I need
to.&rdquo; Philip knew that she was not speaking the truth. The gentility of
her class made her use this pretence to avoid the stigma attached to earning
her living.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My family&rsquo;s very well-connected,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
Philip smiled faintly, and she noticed it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you believe I&rsquo;m telling you the truth?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
She looked at him suspiciously, but in a moment could not resist the temptation
to impress him with the splendour of her early days.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My father always kept a dog-cart, and we had three servants. We had a
cook and a housemaid and an odd man. We used to grow beautiful roses. People
used to stop at the gate and ask who the house belonged to, the roses were so
beautiful. Of course it isn&rsquo;t very nice for me having to mix with them
girls in the shop, it&rsquo;s not the class of person I&rsquo;ve been used to,
and sometimes I really think I&rsquo;ll give up business on that account.
It&rsquo;s not the work I mind, don&rsquo;t think that; but it&rsquo;s the
class of people I have to mix with.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They were sitting opposite one another in the train, and Philip, listening
sympathetically to what she said, was quite happy. He was amused at her naivete
and slightly touched. There was a very faint colour in her cheeks. He was
thinking that it would be delightful to kiss the tip of her chin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The moment you come into the shop I saw you was a gentleman in every
sense of the word. Was your father a professional man?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He was a doctor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can always tell a professional man. There&rsquo;s something about
them, I don&rsquo;t know what it is, but I know at once.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They walked along from the station together.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, I want you to come and see another play with me,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You might go so far as to say you&rsquo;d like to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. Let&rsquo;s fix a day. Would Saturday night
suit you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They made further arrangements, and then found themselves at the corner of the
road in which she lived. She gave him her hand, and he held it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, I do so awfully want to call you Mildred.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You may if you like, I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll call me Philip, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will if I can think of it. It seems more natural to call you Mr.
Carey.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He drew her slightly towards him, but she leaned back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you kiss me good-night?&rdquo; he whispered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Impudence!&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
She snatched away her hand and hurried towards her house.
</p>

<p>
Philip bought tickets for Saturday night. It was not one of the days on which
she got off early and therefore she would have no time to go home and change;
but she meant to bring a frock up with her in the morning and hurry into her
clothes at the shop. If the manageress was in a good temper she would let her
go at seven. Philip had agreed to wait outside from a quarter past seven
onwards. He looked forward to the occasion with painful eagerness, for in the
cab on the way from the theatre to the station he thought she would let him
kiss her. The vehicle gave every facility for a man to put his arm round a
girl&rsquo;s waist (an advantage which the hansom had over the taxi of the
present day), and the delight of that was worth the cost of the evening&rsquo;s
entertainment.
</p>

<p>
But on Saturday afternoon when he went in to have tea, in order to confirm the
arrangements, he met the man with the fair moustache coming out of the shop. He
knew by now that he was called Miller. He was a naturalized German, who had
anglicised his name, and he had lived many years in England. Philip had heard
him speak, and, though his English was fluent and natural, it had not quite the
intonation of the native. Philip knew that he was flirting with Mildred, and he
was horribly jealous of him; but he took comfort in the coldness of her
temperament, which otherwise distressed him; and, thinking her incapable of
passion, he looked upon his rival as no better off than himself. But his heart
sank now, for his first thought was that Miller&rsquo;s sudden appearance might
interfere with the jaunt which he had so looked forward to. He entered, sick
with apprehension. The waitress came up to him, took his order for tea, and
presently brought it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry,&rdquo; she said, with an expression on her face
of real distress. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be able to come tonight after
all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so stern about it,&rdquo; she laughed.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my fault. My aunt was taken ill last night, and
it&rsquo;s the girl&rsquo;s night out so I must go and sit with her. She
can&rsquo;t be left alone, can she?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter. I&rsquo;ll see you home instead.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve got the tickets. It would be a pity to waste
them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He took them out of his pocket and deliberately tore them up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you doing that for?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose I want to go and see a rotten musical comedy by
myself, do you? I only took seats there for your sake.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t see me home if that&rsquo;s what you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made other arrangements.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by that. You&rsquo;re just as selfish
as all the rest of them. You only think of yourself. It&rsquo;s not my fault if
my aunt&rsquo;s queer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She quickly wrote out his bill and left him. Philip knew very little about
women, or he would have been aware that one should accept their most
transparent lies. He made up his mind that he would watch the shop and see for
certain whether Mildred went out with the German. He had an unhappy passion for
certainty. At seven he stationed himself on the opposite pavement. He looked
about for Miller, but did not see him. In ten minutes she came out, she had on
the cloak and shawl which she had worn when he took her to the Shaftesbury
Theatre. It was obvious that she was not going home. She saw him before he had
time to move away, started a little, and then came straight up to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Taking the air,&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re spying on me, you dirty little cad. I thought you was a
gentleman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you think a gentleman would be likely to take any interest in
you?&rdquo; he murmured.
</p>

<p>
There was a devil within him which forced him to make matters worse. He wanted
to hurt her as much as she was hurting him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose I can change my mind if I like. I&rsquo;m not obliged to come
out with you. I tell you I&rsquo;m going home, and I won&rsquo;t be followed or
spied upon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you seen Miller today?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no business of yours. In point of fact I haven&rsquo;t, so
you&rsquo;re wrong again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I saw him this afternoon. He&rsquo;d just come out of the shop when I
went in.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what if he did? I can go out with him if I want to, can&rsquo;t I?
I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ve got to say to it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s keeping you waiting, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d rather wait for him than have you wait for me. Put that
in your pipe and smoke it. And now p&rsquo;raps you&rsquo;ll go off home and
mind your own business in future.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His mood changed suddenly from anger to despair, and his voice trembled when he
spoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, don&rsquo;t be beastly with me, Mildred. You know I&rsquo;m
awfully fond of you. I think I love you with all my heart. Won&rsquo;t you
change your mind? I was looking forward to this evening so awfully. You see, he
hasn&rsquo;t come, and he can&rsquo;t care twopence about you really.
Won&rsquo;t you dine with me? I&rsquo;ll get some more tickets, and we&rsquo;ll
go anywhere you like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I tell you I won&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s no good you talking. I&rsquo;ve
made up my mind, and when I make up my mind I keep to it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked at her for a moment. His heart was torn with anguish. People were
hurrying past them on the pavement, and cabs and omnibuses rolled by noisily.
He saw that Mildred&rsquo;s eyes were wandering. She was afraid of missing
Miller in the crowd.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go on like this,&rdquo; groaned Philip. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
too degrading. If I go now I go for good. Unless you&rsquo;ll come with me
tonight you&rsquo;ll never see me again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You seem to think that&rsquo;ll be an awful thing for me. All I say is,
good riddance to bad rubbish.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then good-bye.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He nodded and limped away slowly, for he hoped with all his heart that she
would call him back. At the next lamp-post he stopped and looked over his
shoulder. He thought she might beckon to him&mdash;he was willing to forget
everything, he was ready for any humiliation&mdash;but she had turned away, and
apparently had ceased to trouble about him. He realised that she was glad to be
quit of him.

<h2>LIX</h2>

<p>
Philip passed the evening wretchedly. He had told his landlady that he would
not be in, so there was nothing for him to eat, and he had to go to
Gatti&rsquo;s for dinner. Afterwards he went back to his rooms, but Griffiths
on the floor above him was having a party, and the noisy merriment made his own
misery more hard to bear. He went to a music-hall, but it was Saturday night
and there was standing-room only: after half an hour of boredom his legs grew
tired and he went home. He tried to read, but he could not fix his attention;
and yet it was necessary that he should work hard. His examination in biology
was in little more than a fortnight, and, though it was easy, he had neglected
his lectures of late and was conscious that he knew nothing. It was only a
viva, however, and he felt sure that in a fortnight he could find out enough
about the subject to scrape through. He had confidence in his intelligence. He
threw aside his book and gave himself up to thinking deliberately of the matter
which was in his mind all the time.
</p>

<p>
He reproached himself bitterly for his behaviour that evening. Why had he given
her the alternative that she must dine with him or else never see him again? Of
course she refused. He should have allowed for her pride. He had burnt his
ships behind him. It would not be so hard to bear if he thought that she was
suffering now, but he knew her too well: she was perfectly indifferent to him.
If he hadn&rsquo;t been a fool he would have pretended to believe her story; he
ought to have had the strength to conceal his disappointment and the
self-control to master his temper. He could not tell why he loved her. He had
read of the idealisation that takes place in love, but he saw her exactly as
she was. She was not amusing or clever, her mind was common; she had a vulgar
shrewdness which revolted him, she had no gentleness nor softness. As she would
have put it herself, she was on the make. What aroused her admiration was a
clever trick played on an unsuspecting person; to &lsquo;do&rsquo; somebody
always gave her satisfaction. Philip laughed savagely as he thought of her
gentility and the refinement with which she ate her food; she could not bear a
coarse word, so far as her limited vocabulary reached she had a passion for
euphemisms, and she scented indecency everywhere; she never spoke of trousers
but referred to them as nether garments; she thought it slightly indelicate to
blow her nose and did it in a deprecating way. She was dreadfully anaemic and
suffered from the dyspepsia which accompanies that ailing. Philip was repelled
by her flat breast and narrow hips, and he hated the vulgar way in which she
did her hair. He loathed and despised himself for loving her.
</p>

<p>
The fact remained that he was helpless. He felt just as he had felt sometimes
in the hands of a bigger boy at school. He had struggled against the superior
strength till his own strength was gone, and he was rendered quite
powerless&mdash;he remembered the peculiar languor he had felt in his limbs,
almost as though he were paralysed&mdash;so that he could not help himself at
all. He might have been dead. He felt just that same weakness now. He loved the
woman so that he knew he had never loved before. He did not mind her faults of
person or of character, he thought he loved them too: at all events they meant
nothing to him. It did not seem himself that was concerned; he felt that he had
been seized by some strange force that moved him against his will, contrary to
his interests; and because he had a passion for freedom he hated the chains
which bound him. He laughed at himself when he thought how often he had longed
to experience the overwhelming passion. He cursed himself because he had given
way to it. He thought of the beginnings; nothing of all this would have
happened if he had not gone into the shop with Dunsford. The whole thing was
his own fault. Except for his ridiculous vanity he would never have troubled
himself with the ill-mannered slut.
</p>

<p>
At all events the occurrences of that evening had finished the whole affair.
Unless he was lost to all sense of shame he could not go back. He wanted
passionately to get rid of the love that obsessed him; it was degrading and
hateful. He must prevent himself from thinking of her. In a little while the
anguish he suffered must grow less. His mind went back to the past. He wondered
whether Emily Wilkinson and Fanny Price had endured on his account anything
like the torment that he suffered now. He felt a pang of remorse.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know then what it was like,&rdquo; he said to himself.
</p>

<p>
He slept very badly. The next day was Sunday, and he worked at his biology. He
sat with the book in front of him, forming the words with his lips in order to
fix his attention, but he could remember nothing. He found his thoughts going
back to Mildred every minute, and he repeated to himself the exact words of the
quarrel they had had. He had to force himself back to his book. He went out for
a walk. The streets on the South side of the river were dingy enough on
week-days, but there was an energy, a coming and going, which gave them a
sordid vivacity; but on Sundays, with no shops open, no carts in the roadway,
silent and depressed, they were indescribably dreary. Philip thought that day
would never end. But he was so tired that he slept heavily, and when Monday
came he entered upon life with determination. Christmas was approaching, and a
good many of the students had gone into the country for the short holiday
between the two parts of the winter session; but Philip had refused his
uncle&rsquo;s invitation to go down to Blackstable. He had given the
approaching examination as his excuse, but in point of fact he had been
unwilling to leave London and Mildred. He had neglected his work so much that
now he had only a fortnight to learn what the curriculum allowed three months
for. He set to work seriously. He found it easier each day not to think of
Mildred. He congratulated himself on his force of character. The pain he
suffered was no longer anguish, but a sort of soreness, like what one might be
expected to feel if one had been thrown off a horse and, though no bones were
broken, were bruised all over and shaken. Philip found that he was able to
observe with curiosity the condition he had been in during the last few weeks.
He analysed his feelings with interest. He was a little amused at himself. One
thing that struck him was how little under those circumstances it mattered what
one thought; the system of personal philosophy, which had given him great
satisfaction to devise, had not served him. He was puzzled by this.
</p>

<p>
But sometimes in the street he would see a girl who looked so like Mildred that
his heart seemed to stop beating. Then he could not help himself, he hurried on
to catch her up, eager and anxious, only to find that it was a total stranger.
Men came back from the country, and he went with Dunsford to have tea at an A.
B. C. shop. The well-known uniform made him so miserable that he could not
speak. The thought came to him that perhaps she had been transferred to another
establishment of the firm for which she worked, and he might suddenly find
himself face to face with her. The idea filled him with panic, so that he
feared Dunsford would see that something was the matter with him: he could not
think of anything to say; he pretended to listen to what Dunsford was talking
about; the conversation maddened him; and it was all he could do to prevent
himself from crying out to Dunsford for Heaven&rsquo;s sake to hold his tongue.
</p>

<p>
Then came the day of his examination. Philip, when his turn arrived, went
forward to the examiner&rsquo;s table with the utmost confidence. He answered
three or four questions. Then they showed him various specimens; he had been to
very few lectures and, as soon as he was asked about things which he could not
learn from books, he was floored. He did what he could to hide his ignorance,
the examiner did not insist, and soon his ten minutes were over. He felt
certain he had passed; but next day, when he went up to the examination
buildings to see the result posted on the door, he was astounded not to find
his number among those who had satisfied the examiners. In amazement he read
the list three times. Dunsford was with him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, I&rsquo;m awfully sorry you&rsquo;re ploughed,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
He had just inquired Philip&rsquo;s number. Philip turned and saw by his
radiant face that Dunsford had passed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t matter a bit,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
jolly glad you&rsquo;re all right. I shall go up again in July.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was very anxious to pretend he did not mind, and on their way back along The
Embankment insisted on talking of indifferent things. Dunsford good-naturedly
wanted to discuss the causes of Philip&rsquo;s failure, but Philip was
obstinately casual. He was horribly mortified; and the fact that Dunsford, whom
he looked upon as a very pleasant but quite stupid fellow, had passed made his
own rebuff harder to bear. He had always been proud of his intelligence, and
now he asked himself desperately whether he was not mistaken in the opinion he
held of himself. In the three months of the winter session the students who had
joined in October had already shaken down into groups, and it was clear which
were brilliant, which were clever or industrious, and which were
&lsquo;rotters.&rsquo; Philip was conscious that his failure was a surprise to
no one but himself. It was tea-time, and he knew that a lot of men would be
having tea in the basement of the Medical School: those who had passed the
examination would be exultant, those who disliked him would look at him with
satisfaction, and the poor devils who had failed would sympathise with him in
order to receive sympathy. His instinct was not to go near the hospital for a
week, when the affair would be no more thought of, but, because he hated so
much to go just then, he went: he wanted to inflict suffering upon himself. He
forgot for the moment his maxim of life to follow his inclinations with due
regard for the policeman round the corner; or, if he acted in accordance with
it, there must have been some strange morbidity in his nature which made him
take a grim pleasure in self-torture.
</p>

<p>
But later on, when he had endured the ordeal to which he forced himself, going
out into the night after the noisy conversation in the smoking-room, he was
seized with a feeling of utter loneliness. He seemed to himself absurd and
futile. He had an urgent need of consolation, and the temptation to see Mildred
was irresistible. He thought bitterly that there was small chance of
consolation from her; but he wanted to see her even if he did not speak to her;
after all, she was a waitress and would be obliged to serve him. She was the
only person in the world he cared for. There was no use in hiding that fact
from himself. Of course it would be humiliating to go back to the shop as
though nothing had happened, but he had not much self-respect left. Though he
would not confess it to himself, he had hoped each day that she would write to
him; she knew that a letter addressed to the hospital would find him; but she
had not written: it was evident that she cared nothing if she saw him again or
not. And he kept on repeating to himself:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must see her. I must see her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The desire was so great that he could not give the time necessary to walk, but
jumped in a cab. He was too thrifty to use one when it could possibly be
avoided. He stood outside the shop for a minute or two. The thought came to him
that perhaps she had left, and in terror he walked in quickly. He saw her at
once. He sat down and she came up to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A cup of tea and a muffin, please,&rdquo; he ordered.
</p>

<p>
He could hardly speak. He was afraid for a moment that he was going to cry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I almost thought you was dead,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
She was smiling. Smiling! She seemed to have forgotten completely that last
scene which Philip had repeated to himself a hundred times.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought if you&rsquo;d wanted to see me you&rsquo;d write,&rdquo; he
answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got too much to do to think about writing letters.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It seemed impossible for her to say a gracious thing. Philip cursed the fate
which chained him to such a woman. She went away to fetch his tea.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would you like me to sit down for a minute or two?&rdquo; she said, when
she brought it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where have you been all this time?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in London.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d gone away for the holidays. Why haven&rsquo;t you
been in then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip looked at her with haggard, passionate eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember that I said I&rsquo;d never see you
again?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you doing now then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She seemed anxious to make him drink up the cup of his humiliation; but he knew
her well enough to know that she spoke at random; she hurt him frightfully, and
never even tried to. He did not answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was a nasty trick you played on me, spying on me like that. I always
thought you was a gentleman in every sense of the word.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be beastly to me, Mildred. I can&rsquo;t bear it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are a funny feller. I can&rsquo;t make you out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very simple. I&rsquo;m such a blasted fool as to love you
with all my heart and soul, and I know that you don&rsquo;t care twopence for
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you had been a gentleman I think you&rsquo;d have come next day and
begged my pardon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She had no mercy. He looked at her neck and thought how he would like to jab it
with the knife he had for his muffin. He knew enough anatomy to make pretty
certain of getting the carotid artery. And at the same time he wanted to cover
her pale, thin face with kisses.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I could only make you understand how frightfully I&rsquo;m in love
with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t begged my pardon yet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He grew very white. She felt that she had done nothing wrong on that occasion.
She wanted him now to humble himself. He was very proud. For one instant he
felt inclined to tell her to go to hell, but he dared not. His passion made him
abject. He was willing to submit to anything rather than not see her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry, Mildred. I beg your pardon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had to force the words out. It was a horrible effort.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve said that I don&rsquo;t mind telling you that I wish I
had come out with you that evening. I thought Miller was a gentleman, but
I&rsquo;ve discovered my mistake now. I soon sent him about his
business.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip gave a little gasp.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mildred, won&rsquo;t you come out with me tonight? Let&rsquo;s go and
dine somewhere.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t. My aunt&rsquo;ll be expecting me home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send her a wire. You can say you&rsquo;ve been detained in
the shop; she won&rsquo;t know any better. Oh, do come, for God&rsquo;s sake. I
haven&rsquo;t seen you for so long, and I want to talk to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked down at her clothes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind about that. We&rsquo;ll go somewhere where it doesn&rsquo;t
matter how you&rsquo;re dressed. And we&rsquo;ll go to a music-hall afterwards.
Please say yes. It would give me so much pleasure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She hesitated a moment; he looked at her with pitifully appealing eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mind if I do. I haven&rsquo;t been out anywhere
since I don&rsquo;t know how long.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was with the greatest difficulty he could prevent himself from seizing her
hand there and then to cover it with kisses.
</p>

<h2>LX</h2>

<p>
They dined in Soho. Philip was tremulous with joy. It was not one of the more
crowded of those cheap restaurants where the respectable and needy dine in the
belief that it is bohemian and the assurance that it is economical. It was a
humble establishment, kept by a good man from Rouen and his wife, that Philip
had discovered by accident. He had been attracted by the Gallic look of the
window, in which was generally an uncooked steak on one plate and on each side
two dishes of raw vegetables. There was one seedy French waiter, who was
attempting to learn English in a house where he never heard anything but
French; and the customers were a few ladies of easy virtue, a menage or two,
who had their own napkins reserved for them, and a few queer men who came in
for hurried, scanty meals.
</p>

<p>
Here Mildred and Philip were able to get a table to themselves. Philip sent the
waiter for a bottle of Burgundy from the neighbouring tavern, and they had a
potage aux herbes, a steak from the window aux pommes, and an omelette au
kirsch. There was really an air of romance in the meal and in the place.
Mildred, at first a little reserved in her appreciation&mdash;&ldquo;I never
quite trust these foreign places, you never know what there is in these messed
up dishes&rdquo;&mdash;was insensibly moved by it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I like this place, Philip,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You feel you can put
your elbows on the table, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A tall fellow came in, with a mane of gray hair and a ragged thin beard. He
wore a dilapidated cloak and a wide-awake hat. He nodded to Philip, who had met
him there before.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He looks like an anarchist,&rdquo; said Mildred.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is, one of the most dangerous in Europe. He&rsquo;s been in every
prison on the Continent and has assassinated more persons than any gentleman
unhung. He always goes about with a bomb in his pocket, and of course it makes
conversation a little difficult because if you don&rsquo;t agree with him he
lays it on the table in a marked manner.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked at the man with horror and surprise, and then glanced suspiciously
at Philip. She saw that his eyes were laughing. She frowned a little.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting at me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He gave a little shout of joy. He was so happy. But Mildred didn&rsquo;t like
being laughed at.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything funny in telling lies.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be cross.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He took her hand, which was lying on the table, and pressed it gently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are lovely, and I could kiss the ground you walk on,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
The greenish pallor of her skin intoxicated him, and her thin white lips had an
extraordinary fascination. Her anaemia made her rather short of breath, and she
held her mouth slightly open. It seemed to add somehow to the attractiveness of
her face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You do like me a bit, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, if I didn&rsquo;t I suppose I shouldn&rsquo;t be here, should I?
You&rsquo;re a gentleman in every sense of the word, I will say that for
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They had finished their dinner and were drinking coffee. Philip, throwing
economy to the winds, smoked a three-penny cigar.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t imagine what a pleasure it is to me just to sit opposite
and look at you. I&rsquo;ve yearned for you. I was sick for a sight of
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mildred smiled a little and faintly flushed. She was not then suffering from
the dyspepsia which generally attacked her immediately after a meal. She felt
more kindly disposed to Philip than ever before, and the unaccustomed
tenderness in her eyes filled him with joy. He knew instinctively that it was
madness to give himself into her hands; his only chance was to treat her
casually and never allow her to see the untamed passions that seethed in his
breast; she would only take advantage of his weakness; but he could not be
prudent now: he told her all the agony he had endured during the separation
from her; he told her of his struggles with himself, how he had tried to get
over his passion, thought he had succeeded, and how he found out that it was as
strong as ever. He knew that he had never really wanted to get over it. He
loved her so much that he did not mind suffering. He bared his heart to her. He
showed her proudly all his weakness.
</p>

<p>
Nothing would have pleased him more than to sit on in the cosy, shabby
restaurant, but he knew that Mildred wanted entertainment. She was restless
and, wherever she was, wanted after a while to go somewhere else. He dared not
bore her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, how about going to a music-hall?&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
He thought rapidly that if she cared for him at all she would say she preferred
to stay there.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was just thinking we ought to be going if we are going,&rdquo; she
answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come on then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip waited impatiently for the end of the performance. He had made up his
mind exactly what to do, and when they got into the cab he passed his arm, as
though almost by accident, round her waist. But he drew it back quickly with a
little cry. He had pricked himself. She laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There, that comes of putting your arm where it&rsquo;s got no business
to be,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I always know when men try and put their arm
round my waist. That pin always catches them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be more careful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He put his arm round again. She made no objection.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so comfortable,&rdquo; he sighed blissfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So long as you&rsquo;re happy,&rdquo; she retorted.
</p>

<p>
They drove down St. James&rsquo; Street into the Park, and Philip quickly
kissed her. He was strangely afraid of her, and it required all his courage.
She turned her lips to him without speaking. She neither seemed to mind nor to
like it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you only knew how long I&rsquo;ve wanted to do that,&rdquo; he
murmured.
</p>

<p>
He tried to kiss her again, but she turned her head away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Once is enough,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
On the chance of kissing her a second time he travelled down to Herne Hill with
her, and at the end of the road in which she lived he asked her:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you give me another kiss?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked at him indifferently and then glanced up the road to see that no one
was in sight.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He seized her in his arms and kissed her passionately, but she pushed him away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mind my hat, silly. You are clumsy,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
He saw her then every day. He began going to lunch at the shop, but Mildred
stopped him: she said it made the girls talk; so he had to content himself with
tea; but he always waited about to walk with her to the station; and once or
twice a week they dined together. He gave her little presents, a gold bangle,
gloves, handkerchiefs, and the like. He was spending more than he could afford,
but he could not help it: it was only when he gave her anything that she showed
any affection. She knew the price of everything, and her gratitude was in exact
proportion with the value of his gift. He did not care. He was too happy when
she volunteered to kiss him to mind by what means he got her demonstrativeness.
He discovered that she found Sundays at home tedious, so he went down to Herne
Hill in the morning, met her at the end of the road, and went to church with
her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I always like to go to church once,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It looks
well, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then she went back to dinner, he got a scrappy meal at a hotel, and in the
afternoon they took a walk in Brockwell Park. They had nothing much to say to
one another, and Philip, desperately afraid she was bored (she was very easily
bored), racked his brain for topics of conversation. He realised that these
walks amused neither of them, but he could not bear to leave her, and did all
he could to lengthen them till she became tired and out of temper. He knew that
she did not care for him, and he tried to force a love which his reason told
him was not in her nature: she was cold. He had no claim on her, but he could
not help being exacting. Now that they were more intimate he found it less easy
to control his temper; he was often irritable and could not help saying bitter
things. Often they quarrelled, and she would not speak to him for a while; but
this always reduced him to subjection, and he crawled before her. He was angry
with himself for showing so little dignity. He grew furiously jealous if he saw
her speaking to any other man in the shop, and when he was jealous he seemed to
be beside himself. He would deliberately insult her, leave the shop and spend
afterwards a sleepless night tossing on his bed, by turns angry and remorseful.
Next day he would go to the shop and appeal for forgiveness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry with me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so
awfully fond of you that I can&rsquo;t help myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One of these days you&rsquo;ll go too far,&rdquo; she answered.
</p>

<p>
He was anxious to come to her home in order that the greater intimacy should
give him an advantage over the stray acquaintances she made during her
working-hours; but she would not let him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My aunt would think it so funny,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
He suspected that her refusal was due only to a disinclination to let him see
her aunt. Mildred had represented her as the widow of a professional man (that
was her formula of distinction), and was uneasily conscious that the good woman
could hardly be called distinguished. Philip imagined that she was in point of
fact the widow of a small tradesman. He knew that Mildred was a snob. But he
found no means by which he could indicate to her that he did not mind how
common the aunt was.
</p>

<p>
Their worst quarrel took place one evening at dinner when she told him that a
man had asked her to go to a play with him. Philip turned pale, and his face
grew hard and stern.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going?&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I? He&rsquo;s a very nice gentlemanly fellow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you anywhere you like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t the same thing. I can&rsquo;t always go about with
you. Besides he&rsquo;s asked me to fix my own day, and I&rsquo;ll just go one
evening when I&rsquo;m not going out with you. It won&rsquo;t make any
difference to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you had any sense of decency, if you had any gratitude, you
wouldn&rsquo;t dream of going.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by gratitude. If you&rsquo;re referring
to the things you&rsquo;ve given me you can have them back. I don&rsquo;t want
them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her voice had the shrewish tone it sometimes got.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not very lively, always going about with you. It&rsquo;s
always do you love me, do you love me, till I just get about sick of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He knew it was madness to go on asking her that, but he could not help himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I like you all right,&rdquo; she would answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that all? I love you with all my heart.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not that sort, I&rsquo;m not one to say much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you knew how happy just one word would make me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what I always say is, people must take me as they find me, and if
they don&rsquo;t like it they can lump it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But sometimes she expressed herself more plainly still, and, when he asked the
question, answered:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t go on at that again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then he became sulky and silent. He hated her.
</p>

<p>
And now he said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, well, if you feel like that about it I wonder you condescend to come
out with me at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my seeking, you can be very sure of that, you just force
me to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His pride was bitterly hurt, and he answered madly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m just good enough to stand you dinners and theatres
when there&rsquo;s no one else to do it, and when someone else turns up I can
go to hell. Thank you, I&rsquo;m about sick of being made a convenience.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be talked to like that by anyone. I&rsquo;ll just
show you how much I want your dirty dinner.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She got up, put on her jacket, and walked quickly out of the restaurant. Philip
sat on. He determined he would not move, but ten minutes afterwards he jumped
in a cab and followed her. He guessed that she would take a &rsquo;bus to
Victoria, so that they would arrive about the same time. He saw her on the
platform, escaped her notice, and went down to Herne Hill in the same train. He
did not want to speak to her till she was on the way home and could not escape
him.
</p>

<p>
As soon as she had turned out of the main street, brightly lit and noisy with
traffic, he caught her up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mildred,&rdquo; he called.
</p>

<p>
She walked on and would neither look at him nor answer. He repeated her name.
Then she stopped and faced him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you want? I saw you hanging about Victoria. Why don&rsquo;t
you leave me alone?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry. Won&rsquo;t you make it up?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sick of your temper and your jealousy. I don&rsquo;t care
for you, I never have cared for you, and I never shall care for you. I
don&rsquo;t want to have anything more to do with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She walked on quickly, and he had to hurry to keep up with her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You never make allowances for me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all
very well to be jolly and amiable when you&rsquo;re indifferent to anyone.
It&rsquo;s very hard when you&rsquo;re as much in love as I am. Have mercy on
me. I don&rsquo;t mind that you don&rsquo;t care for me. After all you
can&rsquo;t help it. I only want you to let me love you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She walked on, refusing to speak, and Philip saw with agony that they had only
a few hundred yards to go before they reached her house. He abased himself. He
poured out an incoherent story of love and penitence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll only forgive me this time I promise you you&rsquo;ll
never have to complain of me in future. You can go out with whoever you choose.
I&rsquo;ll be only too glad if you&rsquo;ll come with me when you&rsquo;ve got
nothing better to do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She stopped again, for they had reached the corner at which he always left her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now you can take yourself off. I won&rsquo;t have you coming up to the
door.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go till you say you&rsquo;ll forgive me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick and tired of the whole thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He hesitated a moment, for he had an instinct that he could say something that
would move her. It made him feel almost sick to utter the words.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is cruel, I have so much to put up with. You don&rsquo;t know what it
is to be a cripple. Of course you don&rsquo;t like me. I can&rsquo;t expect you
to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Philip, I didn&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; she answered quickly, with a
sudden break of pity in her voice. &ldquo;You know it&rsquo;s not true.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was beginning to act now, and his voice was husky and low.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve felt it,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
She took his hand and looked at him, and her own eyes were filled with tears.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I promise you it never made any difference to me. I never thought about
it after the first day or two.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He kept a gloomy, tragic silence. He wanted her to think he was overcome with
emotion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know I like you awfully, Philip. Only you are so trying sometimes.
Let&rsquo;s make it up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She put up her lips to his, and with a sigh of relief he kissed her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now are you happy again?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Madly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She bade him good-night and hurried down the road. Next day he took her in a
little watch with a brooch to pin on her dress. She had been hankering for it.
</p>

<p>
But three or four days later, when she brought him his tea, Mildred said to
him:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You remember what you promised the other night? You mean to keep that,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He knew exactly what she meant and was prepared for her next words.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m going out with that gentleman I told you about
tonight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right. I hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind, do you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had himself now under excellent control.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not going
to make myself more disagreeable than I can help.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She was excited over the outing and talked about it willingly. Philip wondered
whether she did so in order to pain him or merely because she was callous. He
was in the habit of condoning her cruelty by the thought of her stupidity. She
had not the brains to see when she was wounding him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not much fun to be in love with a girl who has no imagination
and no sense of humour,&rdquo; he thought, as he listened.
</p>

<p>
But the want of these things excused her. He felt that if he had not realised
this he could never forgive her for the pain she caused him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got seats for the Tivoli,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He gave me
my choice and I chose that. And we&rsquo;re going to dine at the Cafe Royal. He
says it&rsquo;s the most expensive place in London.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a gentleman in every sense of the word,&rdquo; thought
Philip, but he clenched his teeth to prevent himself from uttering a syllable.
</p>

<p>
Philip went to the Tivoli and saw Mildred with her companion, a smooth-faced
young man with sleek hair and the spruce look of a commercial traveller,
sitting in the second row of the stalls. Mildred wore a black picture hat with
ostrich feathers in it, which became her well. She was listening to her host
with that quiet smile which Philip knew; she had no vivacity of expression, and
it required broad farce to excite her laughter; but Philip could see that she
was interested and amused. He thought to himself bitterly that her companion,
flashy and jovial, exactly suited her. Her sluggish temperament made her
appreciate noisy people. Philip had a passion for discussion, but no talent for
small-talk. He admired the easy drollery of which some of his friends were
masters, Lawson for instance, and his sense of inferiority made him shy and
awkward. The things which interested him bored Mildred. She expected men to
talk about football and racing, and he knew nothing of either. He did not know
the catchwords which only need be said to excite a laugh.
</p>

<p>
Printed matter had always been a fetish to Philip, and now, in order to make
himself more interesting, he read industriously The Sporting Times.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>LXII</h2>

<p>
Philip did not surrender himself willingly to the passion that consumed him. He
knew that all things human are transitory and therefore that it must cease one
day or another. He looked forward to that day with eager longing. Love was like
a parasite in his heart, nourishing a hateful existence on his life&rsquo;s
blood; it absorbed his existence so intensely that he could take pleasure in
nothing else. He had been used to delight in the grace of St. James&rsquo;
Park, and often he sat and looked at the branches of a tree silhouetted against
the sky, it was like a Japanese print; and he found a continual magic in the
beautiful Thames with its barges and its wharfs; the changing sky of London had
filled his soul with pleasant fancies. But now beauty meant nothing to him. He
was bored and restless when he was not with Mildred. Sometimes he thought he
would console his sorrow by looking at pictures, but he walked through the
National Gallery like a sight-seer; and no picture called up in him a thrill of
emotion. He wondered if he could ever care again for all the things he had
loved. He had been devoted to reading, but now books were meaningless; and he
spent his spare hours in the smoking-room of the hospital club, turning over
innumerable periodicals. This love was a torment, and he resented bitterly the
subjugation in which it held him; he was a prisoner and he longed for freedom.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes he awoke in the morning and felt nothing; his soul leaped, for he
thought he was free; he loved no longer; but in a little while, as he grew wide
awake, the pain settled in his heart, and he knew that he was not cured yet.
Though he yearned for Mildred so madly he despised her. He thought to himself
that there could be no greater torture in the world than at the same time to
love and to contemn.
</p>

<p>
Philip, burrowing as was his habit into the state of his feelings, discussing
with himself continually his condition, came to the conclusion that he could
only cure himself of his degrading passion by making Mildred his mistress. It
was sexual hunger that he suffered from, and if he could satisfy this he might
free himself from the intolerable chains that bound him. He knew that Mildred
did not care for him at all in that way. When he kissed her passionately she
withdrew herself from him with instinctive distaste. She had no sensuality.
Sometimes he had tried to make her jealous by talking of adventures in Paris,
but they did not interest her; once or twice he had sat at other tables in the
tea-shop and affected to flirt with the waitress who attended them, but she was
entirely indifferent. He could see that it was no pretence on her part.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t mind my not sitting at one of your tables this
afternoon?&rdquo; he asked once, when he was walking to the station with her.
&ldquo;Yours seemed to be all full.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was not a fact, but she did not contradict him. Even if his desertion
meant nothing to her he would have been grateful if she had pretended it did. A
reproach would have been balm to his soul.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s silly of you to sit at the same table every day. You
ought to give the other girls a turn now and again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But the more he thought of it the more he was convinced that complete surrender
on her part was his only way to freedom. He was like a knight of old,
metamorphosed by magic spells, who sought the potions which should restore him
to his fair and proper form. Philip had only one hope. Mildred greatly desired
to go to Paris. To her, as to most English people, it was the centre of gaiety
and fashion: she had heard of the Magasin du Louvre, where you could get the
very latest thing for about half the price you had to pay in London; a friend
of hers had passed her honeymoon in Paris and had spent all day at the Louvre;
and she and her husband, my dear, they never went to bed till six in the
morning all the time they were there; the Moulin Rouge and I don&rsquo;t know
what all. Philip did not care that if she yielded to his desires it would only
be the unwilling price she paid for the gratification of her wish. He did not
care upon what terms he satisfied his passion. He had even had a mad,
melodramatic idea to drug her. He had plied her with liquor in the hope of
exciting her, but she had no taste for wine; and though she liked him to order
champagne because it looked well, she never drank more than half a glass. She
liked to leave untouched a large glass filled to the brim.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It shows the waiters who you are,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
Philip chose an opportunity when she seemed more than usually friendly. He had
an examination in anatomy at the end of March. Easter, which came a week later,
would give Mildred three whole days holiday.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, why don&rsquo;t you come over to Paris then?&rdquo; he suggested.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;d have such a ripping time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How could you? It would cost no end of money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip had thought of that. It would cost at least five-and-twenty pounds. It
was a large sum to him. He was willing to spend his last penny on her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What does that matter? Say you&rsquo;ll come, darling.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What next, I should like to know. I can&rsquo;t see myself going away
with a man that I wasn&rsquo;t married to. You oughtn&rsquo;t to suggest such a
thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What does it matter?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He enlarged on the glories of the Rue de la Paix and the garish splendour of
the Folies Bergeres. He described the Louvre and the Bon Marche. He told her
about the Cabaret du Neant, the Abbaye, and the various haunts to which
foreigners go. He painted in glowing colours the side of Paris which he
despised. He pressed her to come with him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know, you say you love me, but if you really loved me you&rsquo;d
want to marry me. You&rsquo;ve never asked me to marry you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know I can&rsquo;t afford it. After all, I&rsquo;m in my first year,
I shan&rsquo;t earn a penny for six years.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not blaming you. I wouldn&rsquo;t marry you if you went
down on your bended knees to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had thought of marriage more than once, but it was a step from which he
shrank. In Paris he had come by the opinion that marriage was a ridiculous
institution of the philistines. He knew also that a permanent tie would ruin
him. He had middle-class instincts, and it seemed a dreadful thing to him to
marry a waitress. A common wife would prevent him from getting a decent
practice. Besides, he had only just enough money to last him till he was
qualified; he could not keep a wife even if they arranged not to have children.
He thought of Cronshaw bound to a vulgar slattern, and he shuddered with
dismay. He foresaw what Mildred, with her genteel ideas and her mean mind,
would become: it was impossible for him to marry her. But he decided only with
his reason; he felt that he must have her whatever happened; and if he could
not get her without marrying her he would do that; the future could look after
itself. It might end in disaster; he did not care. When he got hold of an idea
it obsessed him, he could think of nothing else, and he had a more than common
power to persuade himself of the reasonableness of what he wished to do. He
found himself overthrowing all the sensible arguments which had occurred to him
against marriage. Each day he found that he was more passionately devoted to
her; and his unsatisfied love became angry and resentful.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By George, if I marry her I&rsquo;ll make her pay for all the suffering
I&rsquo;ve endured,&rdquo; he said to himself.
</p>

<p>
At last he could bear the agony no longer. After dinner one evening in the
little restaurant in Soho, to which now they often went, he spoke to her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, did you mean it the other day that you wouldn&rsquo;t marry me if
I asked you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, why not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because I can&rsquo;t live without you. I want you with me always.
I&rsquo;ve tried to get over it and I can&rsquo;t. I never shall now. I want
you to marry me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She had read too many novelettes not to know how to take such an offer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m very grateful to you, Philip. I&rsquo;m very
much flattered at your proposal.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t talk rot. You will marry me, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you think we should be happy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. But what does that matter?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The words were wrung out of him almost against his will. They surprised her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you are a funny chap. Why d&rsquo;you want to marry me then? The
other day you said you couldn&rsquo;t afford it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve got about fourteen hundred pounds left. Two can live
just as cheaply as one. That&rsquo;ll keep us till I&rsquo;m qualified and have
got through with my hospital appointments, and then I can get an
assistantship.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It means you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to earn anything for six years. We
should have about four pounds a week to live on till then, shouldn&rsquo;t
we?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not much more than three. There are all my fees to pay.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what would you get as an assistant?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Three pounds a week.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you mean to say you have to work all that time and spend a small
fortune just to earn three pounds a week at the end of it? I don&rsquo;t see
that I should be any better off than I am now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was silent for a moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you mean to say you won&rsquo;t marry me?&rdquo; he asked
hoarsely. &ldquo;Does my great love mean nothing to you at all?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One has to think of oneself in those things, don&rsquo;t one? I
shouldn&rsquo;t mind marrying, but I don&rsquo;t want to marry if I&rsquo;m
going to be no better off than what I am now. I don&rsquo;t see the use of
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you cared for me you wouldn&rsquo;t think of all that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;P&rsquo;raps not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was silent. He drank a glass of wine in order to get rid of the choking in
his throat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look at that girl who&rsquo;s just going out,&rdquo; said Mildred.
&ldquo;She got them furs at the Bon Marche at Brixton. I saw them in the window
last time I went down there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip smiled grimly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. And
I said to my aunt at the time, I wouldn&rsquo;t buy anything that had been in
the window like that, for everyone to know how much you paid for it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand you. You make me frightfully unhappy, and in
the next breath you talk rot that has nothing to do with what we&rsquo;re
speaking about.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are nasty to me,&rdquo; she answered, aggrieved. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t help noticing those furs, because I said to my aunt…&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a damn what you said to your aunt,&rdquo; he
interrupted impatiently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t use bad language when you speak to me Philip.
You know I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip smiled a little, but his eyes were wild. He was silent for a while. He
looked at her sullenly. He hated, despised, and loved her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I had an ounce of sense I&rsquo;d never see you again,&rdquo; he said
at last. &ldquo;If you only knew how heartily I despise myself for loving
you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a very nice thing to say to me,&rdquo; she replied
sulkily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the
Pavilion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s so funny in you, you start laughing just when
one doesn&rsquo;t expect you to. And if I make you that unhappy why d&rsquo;you
want to take me to the Pavilion? I&rsquo;m quite ready to go home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Merely because I&rsquo;m less unhappy with you than away from
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should like to know what you really think of me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He laughed outright.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear, if you did you&rsquo;d never speak to me again.&rdquo;

<h2>LXIII</h2>

<p>
Philip did not pass the examination in anatomy at the end of March. He and
Dunsford had worked at the subject together on Philip&rsquo;s skeleton, asking
each other questions till both knew by heart every attachment and the meaning
of every nodule and groove on the human bones; but in the examination room
Philip was seized with panic, and failed to give right answers to questions
from a sudden fear that they might be wrong. He knew he was ploughed and did
not even trouble to go up to the building next day to see whether his number
was up. The second failure put him definitely among the incompetent and idle
men of his year.
</p>

<p>
He did not care much. He had other things to think of. He told himself that
Mildred must have senses like anybody else, it was only a question of awakening
them; he had theories about woman, the rip at heart, and thought that there
must come a time with everyone when she would yield to persistence. It was a
question of watching for the opportunity, keeping his temper, wearing her down
with small attentions, taking advantage of the physical exhaustion which opened
the heart to tenderness, making himself a refuge from the petty vexations of
her work. He talked to her of the relations between his friends in Paris and
the fair ladies they admired. The life he described had a charm, an easy
gaiety, in which was no grossness. Weaving into his own recollections the
adventures of Mimi and Rodolphe, of Musette and the rest of them, he poured
into Mildred&rsquo;s ears a story of poverty made picturesque by song and
laughter, of lawless love made romantic by beauty and youth. He never attacked
her prejudices directly, but sought to combat them by the suggestion that they
were suburban. He never let himself be disturbed by her inattention, nor
irritated by her indifference. He thought he had bored her. By an effort he
made himself affable and entertaining; he never let himself be angry, he never
asked for anything, he never complained, he never scolded. When she made
engagements and broke them, he met her next day with a smiling face; when she
excused herself, he said it did not matter. He never let her see that she
pained him. He understood that his passionate grief had wearied her, and he
took care to hide every sentiment which could be in the least degree
troublesome. He was heroic.
</p>

<p>
Though she never mentioned the change, for she did not take any conscious
notice of it, it affected her nevertheless: she became more confidential with
him; she took her little grievances to him, and she always had some grievance
against the manageress of the shop, one of her fellow waitresses, or her aunt;
she was talkative enough now, and though she never said anything that was not
trivial Philip was never tired of listening to her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I like you when you don&rsquo;t want to make love to me,&rdquo; she told
him once.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s flattering for me,&rdquo; he laughed.
</p>

<p>
She did not realise how her words made his heart sink nor what an effort it
needed for him to answer so lightly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind your kissing me now and then. It doesn&rsquo;t
hurt me and it gives you pleasure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Occasionally she went so far as to ask him to take her out to dinner, and the
offer, coming from her, filled him with rapture.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do it to anyone else,&rdquo; she said, by way of
apology. &ldquo;But I know I can with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t give me greater pleasure,&rdquo; he smiled.
</p>

<p>
She asked him to give her something to eat one evening towards the end of
April.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Where would you like to go
afterwards?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s go anywhere. Let&rsquo;s just sit and talk.
You don&rsquo;t mind, do you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rather not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He thought she must be beginning to care for him. Three months before the
thought of an evening spent in conversation would have bored her to death. It
was a fine day, and the spring added to Philip&rsquo;s high spirits. He was
content with very little now.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, won&rsquo;t it be ripping when the summer comes along,&rdquo; he
said, as they drove along on the top of a &rsquo;bus to Soho&mdash;she had
herself suggested that they should not be so extravagant as to go by cab.
&ldquo;We shall be able to spend every Sunday on the river. We&rsquo;ll take
our luncheon in a basket.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She smiled slightly, and he was encouraged to take her hand. She did not
withdraw it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I really think you&rsquo;re beginning to like me a bit,&rdquo; he
smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You ARE silly, you know I like you, or else I shouldn&rsquo;t be here,
should I?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They were old customers at the little restaurant in Soho by now, and the
patronne gave them a smile as they came in. The waiter was obsequious.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me order the dinner tonight,&rdquo; said Mildred.
</p>

<p>
Philip, thinking her more enchanting than ever, gave her the menu, and she
chose her favourite dishes. The range was small, and they had eaten many times
all that the restaurant could provide. Philip was gay. He looked into her eyes,
and he dwelt on every perfection of her pale cheek. When they had finished
Mildred by way of exception took a cigarette. She smoked very seldom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to see a lady smoking,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
She hesitated a moment and then spoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Were you surprised, my asking you to take me out and give me a bit of
dinner tonight?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was delighted.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something to say to you, Philip.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked at her quickly, his heart sank, but he had trained himself well.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, fire away,&rdquo; he said, smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to be silly about it, are you? The fact is
I&rsquo;m going to get married.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
He could think of nothing else to say. He had considered the possibility often
and had imagined to himself what he would do and say. He had suffered agonies
when he thought of the despair he would suffer, he had thought of suicide, of
the mad passion of anger that would seize him; but perhaps he had too
completely anticipated the emotion he would experience, so that now he felt
merely exhausted. He felt as one does in a serious illness when the vitality is
so low that one is indifferent to the issue and wants only to be left alone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;m getting on,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
twenty-four and it&rsquo;s time I settled down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was silent. He looked at the patronne sitting behind the counter, and his
eye dwelt on a red feather one of the diners wore in her hat. Mildred was
nettled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You might congratulate me,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I might, mightn&rsquo;t I? I can hardly believe it&rsquo;s true.
I&rsquo;ve dreamt it so often. It rather tickles me that I should have been so
jolly glad that you asked me to take you out to dinner. Whom are you going to
marry?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Miller,&rdquo; she answered, with a slight blush.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Miller?&rdquo; cried Philip, astounded. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve not seen
him for months.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He came in to lunch one day last week and asked me then. He&rsquo;s
earning very good money. He makes seven pounds a week now and he&rsquo;s got
prospects.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was silent again. He remembered that she had always liked Miller; he
amused her; there was in his foreign birth an exotic charm which she felt
unconsciously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose it was inevitable,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;You were
bound to accept the highest bidder. When are you going to marry?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On Saturday next. I have given notice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip felt a sudden pang.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As soon as that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be married at a registry office. Emil prefers
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip felt dreadfully tired. He wanted to get away from her. He thought he
would go straight to bed. He called for the bill.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put you in a cab and send you down to Victoria. I daresay you
won&rsquo;t have to wait long for a train.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come with me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d rather not if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as you please,&rdquo; she answered haughtily. &ldquo;I
suppose I shall see you at tea-time tomorrow?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I think we&rsquo;d better make a full stop now. I don&rsquo;t see
why I should go on making myself unhappy. I&rsquo;ve paid the cab.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He nodded to her and forced a smile on his lips, then jumped on a &rsquo;bus
and made his way home. He smoked a pipe before he went to bed, but he could
hardly keep his eyes open. He suffered no pain. He fell into a heavy sleep
almost as soon as his head touched the pillow.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>LXIV</h2>

<p>
But about three in the morning Philip awoke and could not sleep again. He began
to think of Mildred. He tried not to, but could not help himself. He repeated
to himself the same thing time after time till his brain reeled. It was
inevitable that she should marry: life was hard for a girl who had to earn her
own living; and if she found someone who could give her a comfortable home she
should not be blamed if she accepted. Philip acknowledged that from her point
of view it would have been madness to marry him: only love could have made such
poverty bearable, and she did not love him. It was no fault of hers; it was a
fact that must be accepted like any other. Philip tried to reason with himself.
He told himself that deep down in his heart was mortified pride; his passion
had begun in wounded vanity, and it was this at bottom which caused now a great
part of his wretchedness. He despised himself as much as he despised her. Then
he made plans for the future, the same plans over and over again, interrupted
by recollections of kisses on her soft pale cheek and by the sound of her voice
with its trailing accent; he had a great deal of work to do, since in the
summer he was taking chemistry as well as the two examinations he had failed
in. He had separated himself from his friends at the hospital, but now he
wanted companionship. There was one happy occurrence: Hayward a fortnight
before had written to say that he was passing through London and had asked him
to dinner; but Philip, unwilling to be bothered, had refused. He was coming
back for the season, and Philip made up his mind to write to him.
</p>

<p>
He was thankful when eight o&rsquo;clock struck and he could get up. He was
pale and weary. But when he had bathed, dressed, and had breakfast, he felt
himself joined up again with the world at large; and his pain was a little
easier to bear. He did not feel like going to lectures that morning, but went
instead to the Army and Navy Stores to buy Mildred a wedding-present. After
much wavering he settled on a dressing-bag. It cost twenty pounds, which was
much more than he could afford, but it was showy and vulgar: he knew she would
be aware exactly how much it cost; he got a melancholy satisfaction in choosing
a gift which would give her pleasure and at the same time indicate for himself
the contempt he had for her.
</p>

<p>
Philip had looked forward with apprehension to the day on which Mildred was to
be married; he was expecting an intolerable anguish; and it was with relief
that he got a letter from Hayward on Saturday morning to say that he was coming
up early on that very day and would fetch Philip to help him to find rooms.
Philip, anxious to be distracted, looked up a time-table and discovered the
only train Hayward was likely to come by; he went to meet him, and the reunion
of the friends was enthusiastic. They left the luggage at the station, and set
off gaily. Hayward characteristically proposed that first of all they should go
for an hour to the National Gallery; he had not seen pictures for some time,
and he stated that it needed a glimpse to set him in tune with life. Philip for
months had had no one with whom he could talk of art and books. Since the Paris
days Hayward had immersed himself in the modern French versifiers, and, such a
plethora of poets is there in France, he had several new geniuses to tell
Philip about. They walked through the gallery pointing out to one another their
favourite pictures; one subject led to another; they talked excitedly. The sun
was shining and the air was warm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and sit in the Park,&rdquo; said Hayward.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll look for rooms after luncheon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The spring was pleasant there. It was a day upon which one felt it good merely
to live. The young green of the trees was exquisite against the sky; and the
sky, pale and blue, was dappled with little white clouds. At the end of the
ornamental water was the gray mass of the Horse Guards. The ordered elegance of
the scene had the charm of an eighteenth-century picture. It reminded you not
of Watteau, whose landscapes are so idyllic that they recall only the woodland
glens seen in dreams, but of the more prosaic Jean-Baptiste Pater.
Philip&rsquo;s heart was filled with lightness. He realised, what he had only
read before, that art (for there was art in the manner in which he looked upon
nature) might liberate the soul from pain.
</p>

<p>
They went to an Italian restaurant for luncheon and ordered themselves a
fiaschetto of Chianti. Lingering over the meal they talked on. They reminded
one another of the people they had known at Heidelberg, they spoke of
Philip&rsquo;s friends in Paris, they talked of books, pictures, morals, life;
and suddenly Philip heard a clock strike three. He remembered that by this time
Mildred was married. He felt a sort of stitch in his heart, and for a minute or
two he could not hear what Hayward was saying. But he filled his glass with
Chianti. He was unaccustomed to alcohol and it had gone to his head. For the
time at all events he was free from care. His quick brain had lain idle for so
many months that he was intoxicated now with conversation. He was thankful to
have someone to talk to who would interest himself in the things that
interested him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s waste this beautiful day in looking for
rooms. I&rsquo;ll put you up tonight. You can look for rooms tomorrow or
Monday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right. What shall we do?&rdquo; answered Hayward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get on a penny steamboat and go down to Greenwich.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The idea appealed to Hayward, and they jumped into a cab which took them to
Westminster Bridge. They got on the steamboat just as she was starting.
Presently Philip, a smile on his lips, spoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I remember when first I went to Paris, Clutton, I think it was, gave a
long discourse on the subject that beauty is put into things by painters and
poets. They create beauty. In themselves there is nothing to choose between the
Campanile of Giotto and a factory chimney. And then beautiful things grow rich
with the emotion that they have aroused in succeeding generations. That is why
old things are more beautiful than modern. The Ode on a Grecian Urn is more
lovely now than when it was written, because for a hundred years lovers have
read it and the sick at heart taken comfort in its lines.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip left Hayward to infer what in the passing scene had suggested these
words to him, and it was a delight to know that he could safely leave the
inference. It was in sudden reaction from the life he had been leading for so
long that he was now deeply affected. The delicate iridescence of the London
air gave the softness of a pastel to the gray stone of the buildings; and in
the wharfs and storehouses there was the severity of grace of a Japanese print.
They went further down; and the splendid channel, a symbol of the great empire,
broadened, and it was crowded with traffic; Philip thought of the painters and
the poets who had made all these things so beautiful, and his heart was filled
with gratitude. They came to the Pool of London, and who can describe its
majesty? The imagination thrills, and Heaven knows what figures people still
its broad stream, Doctor Johnson with Boswell by his side, an old Pepys going
on board a man-o&rsquo;-war: the pageant of English history, and romance, and
high adventure. Philip turned to Hayward with shining eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear Charles Dickens,&rdquo; he murmured, smiling a little at his own
emotion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you rather sorry you chucked painting?&rdquo; asked
Hayward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you like doctoring?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I hate it, but there was nothing else to do. The drudgery of the
first two years is awful, and unfortunately I haven&rsquo;t got the scientific
temperament.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t go on changing professions.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, no. I&rsquo;m going to stick to this. I think I shall like it better
when I get into the wards. I have an idea that I&rsquo;m more interested in
people than in anything else in the world. And as far as I can see, it&rsquo;s
the only profession in which you have your freedom. You carry your knowledge in
your head; with a box of instruments and a few drugs you can make your living
anywhere.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to take a practice then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not for a good long time at any rate,&rdquo; Philip answered. &ldquo;As
soon as I&rsquo;ve got through my hospital appointments I shall get a ship; I
want to go to the East&mdash;the Malay Archipelago, Siam, China, and all that
sort of thing&mdash;and then I shall take odd jobs. Something always comes
along, cholera duty in India and things like that. I want to go from place to
place. I want to see the world. The only way a poor man can do that is by going
in for the medical.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They came to Greenwich then. The noble building of Inigo Jones faced the river
grandly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, look, that must be the place where Poor Jack dived into the mud
for pennies,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
They wandered in the park. Ragged children were playing in it, and it was noisy
with their cries: here and there old seamen were basking in the sun. There was
an air of a hundred years ago.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It seems a pity you wasted two years in Paris,&rdquo; said Hayward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Waste? Look at the movement of that child, look at the pattern which the
sun makes on the ground, shining through the trees, look at that sky&mdash;why,
I should never have seen that sky if I hadn&rsquo;t been to Paris.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hayward thought that Philip choked a sob, and he looked at him with
astonishment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing. I&rsquo;m sorry to be so damned emotional, but for six months
I&rsquo;ve been starved for beauty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You used to be so matter of fact. It&rsquo;s very interesting to hear
you say that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Damn it all, I don&rsquo;t want to be interesting,&rdquo; laughed
Philip. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and have a stodgy tea.&rdquo;
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">

<h2>LXV</h2>

<p>
Hayward&rsquo;s visit did Philip a great deal of good. Each day his thoughts
dwelt less on Mildred. He looked back upon the past with disgust. He could not
understand how he had submitted to the dishonour of such a love; and when he
thought of Mildred it was with angry hatred, because she had submitted him to
so much humiliation. His imagination presented her to him now with her defects
of person and manner exaggerated, so that he shuddered at the thought of having
been connected with her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It just shows how damned weak I am,&rdquo; he said to himself. The
adventure was like a blunder that one had committed at a party so horrible that
one felt nothing could be done to excuse it: the only remedy was to forget. His
horror at the degradation he had suffered helped him. He was like a snake
casting its skin and he looked upon the old covering with nausea. He exulted in
the possession of himself once more; he realised how much of the delight of the
world he had lost when he was absorbed in that madness which they called love;
he had had enough of it; he did not want to be in love any more if love was
that. Philip told Hayward something of what he had gone through.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it Sophocles,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;who prayed for the
time when he would be delivered from the wild beast of passion that devoured
his heart-strings?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip seemed really to be born again. He breathed the circumambient air as
though he had never breathed it before, and he took a child&rsquo;s pleasure in
all the facts of the world. He called his period of insanity six months&rsquo;
hard labour.
</p>

<p>
Hayward had only been settled in London a few days when Philip received from
Blackstable, where it had been sent, a card for a private view at some picture
gallery. He took Hayward, and, on looking at the catalogue, saw that Lawson had
a picture in it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose he sent the card,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go
and find him, he&rsquo;s sure to be in front of his picture.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This, a profile of Ruth Chalice, was tucked away in a corner, and Lawson was
not far from it. He looked a little lost, in his large soft hat and loose, pale
clothes, amongst the fashionable throng that had gathered for the private view.
He greeted Philip with enthusiasm, and with his usual volubility told him that
he had come to live in London, Ruth Chalice was a hussy, he had taken a studio,
Paris was played out, he had a commission for a portrait, and they&rsquo;d
better dine together and have a good old talk. Philip reminded him of his
acquaintance with Hayward, and was entertained to see that Lawson was slightly
awed by Hayward&rsquo;s elegant clothes and grand manner. They sat upon him
better than they had done in the shabby little studio which Lawson and Philip
had shared.
</p>

<p>
At dinner Lawson went on with his news. Flanagan had gone back to America.
Clutton had disappeared. He had come to the conclusion that a man had no chance
of doing anything so long as he was in contact with art and artists: the only
thing was to get right away. To make the step easier he had quarrelled with all
his friends in Paris. He developed a talent for telling them home truths, which
made them bear with fortitude his declaration that he had done with that city
and was settling in Gerona, a little town in the north of Spain which had
attracted him when he saw it from the train on his way to Barcelona. He was
living there now alone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder if he&rsquo;ll ever do any good,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
He was interested in the human side of that struggle to express something which
was so obscure in the man&rsquo;s mind that he was become morbid and querulous.
Philip felt vaguely that he was himself in the same case, but with him it was
the conduct of his life as a whole that perplexed him. That was his means of
self-expression, and what he must do with it was not clear. But he had no time
to continue with this train of thought, for Lawson poured out a frank recital
of his affair with Ruth Chalice. She had left him for a young student who had
just come from England, and was behaving in a scandalous fashion. Lawson really
thought someone ought to step in and save the young man. She would ruin him.
Philip gathered that Lawson&rsquo;s chief grievance was that the rupture had
come in the middle of a portrait he was painting.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Women have no real feeling for art,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They only
pretend they have.&rdquo; But he finished philosophically enough:
&ldquo;However, I got four portraits out of her, and I&rsquo;m not sure if the
last I was working on would ever have been a success.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip envied the easy way in which the painter managed his love affairs. He
had passed eighteen months pleasantly enough, had got an excellent model for
nothing, and had parted from her at the end with no great pang.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what about Cronshaw?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s done for,&rdquo; answered Lawson, with the cheerful
callousness of his youth. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be dead in six months. He got
pneumonia last winter. He was in the English hospital for seven weeks, and when
he came out they told him his only chance was to give up liquor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor devil,&rdquo; smiled the abstemious Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He kept off for a bit. He used to go to the Lilas all the same, he
couldn&rsquo;t keep away from that, but he used to drink hot milk, avec de la
fleur d&rsquo;oranger, and he was damned dull.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I take it you did not conceal the fact from him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he knew it himself. A little while ago he started on whiskey again.
He said he was too old to turn over any new leaves. He would rather be happy
for six months and die at the end of it than linger on for five years. And then
I think he&rsquo;s been awfully hard up lately. You see, he didn&rsquo;t earn
anything while he was ill, and the slut he lives with has been giving him a
rotten time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I remember, the first time I saw him I admired him awfully,&rdquo; said
Philip. &ldquo;I thought he was wonderful. It is sickening that vulgar,
middle-class virtue should pay.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course he was a rotter. He was bound to end in the gutter sooner or
later,&rdquo; said Lawson.
</p>

<p>
Philip was hurt because Lawson would not see the pity of it. Of course it was
cause and effect, but in the necessity with which one follows the other lay all
tragedy of life.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d forgotten,&rdquo; said Lawson. &ldquo;Just after you left
he sent round a present for you. I thought you&rsquo;d be coming back and I
didn&rsquo;t bother about it, and then I didn&rsquo;t think it worth sending
on; but it&rsquo;ll come over to London with the rest of my things, and you can
come to my studio one day and fetch it away if you want it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told me what it is yet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s only a ragged little bit of carpet. I shouldn&rsquo;t
think it&rsquo;s worth anything. I asked him one day what the devil he&rsquo;d
sent the filthy thing for. He told me he&rsquo;d seen it in a shop in the Rue
de Rennes and bought it for fifteen francs. It appears to be a Persian rug. He
said you&rsquo;d asked him the meaning of life and that was the answer. But he
was very drunk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, I know. I&rsquo;ll take it. It was a favourite wheeze of his. He
said I must find out for myself, or else the answer meant nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<h2>LXVI</h2>

<p>
Philip worked well and easily; he had a good deal to do, since he was taking in
July the three parts of the First Conjoint examination, two of which he had
failed in before; but he found life pleasant. He made a new friend. Lawson, on
the lookout for models, had discovered a girl who was understudying at one of
the theatres, and in order to induce her to sit to him arranged a little
luncheon-party one Sunday. She brought a chaperon with her; and to her Philip,
asked to make a fourth, was instructed to confine his attentions. He found this
easy, since she turned out to be an agreeable chatterbox with an amusing
tongue. She asked Philip to go and see her; she had rooms in Vincent Square,
and was always in to tea at five o&rsquo;clock; he went, was delighted with his
welcome, and went again. Mrs. Nesbit was not more than twenty-five, very small,
with a pleasant, ugly face; she had very bright eyes, high cheekbones, and a
large mouth: the excessive contrasts of her colouring reminded one of a
portrait by one of the modern French painters; her skin was very white, her
cheeks were very red, her thick eyebrows, her hair, were very black. The effect
was odd, a little unnatural, but far from unpleasing. She was separated from
her husband and earned her living and her child&rsquo;s by writing penny
novelettes. There were one or two publishers who made a specialty of that sort
of thing, and she had as much work as she could do. It was ill-paid, she
received fifteen pounds for a story of thirty thousand words; but she was
satisfied.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;After all, it only costs the reader twopence,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and they like the same thing over and over again. I just change the
names and that&rsquo;s all. When I&rsquo;m bored I think of the washing and the
rent and clothes for baby, and I go on again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Besides, she walked on at various theatres where they wanted supers and earned
by this when in work from sixteen shillings to a guinea a week. At the end of
her day she was so tired that she slept like a top. She made the best of her
difficult lot. Her keen sense of humour enabled her to get amusement out of
every vexatious circumstance. Sometimes things went wrong, and she found
herself with no money at all; then her trifling possessions found their way to
a pawnshop in the Vauxhall Bridge Road, and she ate bread and butter till
things grew brighter. She never lost her cheerfulness.
</p>

<p>
Philip was interested in her shiftless life, and she made him laugh with the
fantastic narration of her struggles. He asked her why she did not try her hand
at literary work of a better sort, but she knew that she had no talent, and the
abominable stuff she turned out by the thousand words was not only tolerably
paid, but was the best she could do. She had nothing to look forward to but a
continuation of the life she led. She seemed to have no relations, and her
friends were as poor as herself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think of the future,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;As long as I
have enough money for three weeks&rsquo; rent and a pound or two over for food
I never bother. Life wouldn&rsquo;t be worth living if I worried over the
future as well as the present. When things are at their worst I find something
always happens.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Soon Philip grew in the habit of going in to tea with her every day, and so
that his visits might not embarrass her he took in a cake or a pound of butter
or some tea. They started to call one another by their Christian names.
Feminine sympathy was new to him, and he delighted in someone who gave a
willing ear to all his troubles. The hours went quickly. He did not hide his
admiration for her. She was a delightful companion. He could not help comparing
her with Mildred; and he contrasted with the one&rsquo;s obstinate stupidity,
which refused interest to everything she did not know, the other&rsquo;s quick
appreciation and ready intelligence. His heart sank when he thought that he
might have been tied for life to such a woman as Mildred. One evening he told
Norah the whole story of his love. It was not one to give him much reason for
self-esteem, and it was very pleasant to receive such charming sympathy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re well out of it,&rdquo; she said, when he had
finished.
</p>

<p>
She had a funny way at times of holding her head on one side like an Aberdeen
puppy. She was sitting in an upright chair, sewing, for she had no time to do
nothing, and Philip had made himself comfortable at her feet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how heartily thankful I am it&rsquo;s all
over,&rdquo; he sighed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor thing, you must have had a rotten time,&rdquo; she murmured, and by
way of showing her sympathy put her hand on his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
He took it and kissed it, but she withdrew it quickly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo; she asked, with a blush.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you any objection?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked at him for a moment with twinkling eyes, and she smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
He got up on his knees and faced her. She looked into his eyes steadily, and
her large mouth trembled with a smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know, you are a ripper. I&rsquo;m so grateful to you for being nice
to me. I like you so much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be idiotic,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
Philip took hold of her elbows and drew her towards him. She made no
resistance, but bent forward a little, and he kissed her red lips.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo; she asked again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s comfortable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She did not answer, but a tender look came into her eyes, and she passed her
hand softly over his hair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know, it&rsquo;s awfully silly of you to behave like this. We were
such good friends. It would be so jolly to leave it at that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you really want to appeal to my better nature,&rdquo; replied Philip,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll do well not to stroke my cheek while you&rsquo;re doing
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She gave a little chuckle, but she did not stop.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very wrong of me, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
Philip, surprised and a little amused, looked into her eyes, and as he looked
he saw them soften and grow liquid, and there was an expression in them that
enchanted him. His heart was suddenly stirred, and tears came to his eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Norah, you&rsquo;re not fond of me, are you?&rdquo; he asked,
incredulously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You clever boy, you ask such stupid questions.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my dear, it never struck me that you could be.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He flung his arms round her and kissed her, while she, laughing, blushing, and
crying, surrendered herself willingly to his embrace.
</p>

<p>
Presently he released her and sitting back on his heels looked at her
curiously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m blowed!&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so surprised.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And pleased?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Delighted,&rdquo; he cried with all his heart, &ldquo;and so proud and
so happy and so grateful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He took her hands and covered them with kisses. This was the beginning for
Philip of a happiness which seemed both solid and durable. They became lovers
but remained friends. There was in Norah a maternal instinct which received
satisfaction in her love for Philip; she wanted someone to pet, and scold, and
make a fuss of; she had a domestic temperament and found pleasure in looking
after his health and his linen. She pitied his deformity, over which he was so
sensitive, and her pity expressed itself instinctively in tenderness. She was
young, strong, and healthy, and it seemed quite natural to her to give her
love. She had high spirits and a merry soul. She liked Philip because he
laughed with her at all the amusing things in life that caught her fancy, and
above all she liked him because he was he.
</p>

<p>
When she told him this he answered gaily:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense. You like me because I&rsquo;m a silent person and never want
to get a word in.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip did not love her at all. He was extremely fond of her, glad to be with
her, amused and interested by her conversation. She restored his belief in
himself and put healing ointments, as it were, on all the bruises of his soul.
He was immensely flattered that she cared for him. He admired her courage, her
optimism, her impudent defiance of fate; she had a little philosophy of her
own, ingenuous and practical.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know, I don&rsquo;t believe in churches and parsons and all
that,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I believe in God, and I don&rsquo;t believe
He minds much about what you do as long as you keep your end up and help a lame
dog over a stile when you can. And I think people on the whole are very nice,
and I&rsquo;m sorry for those who aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what about afterwards?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, well, I don&rsquo;t know for certain, you know,&rdquo; she smiled,
&ldquo;but I hope for the best. And anyhow there&rsquo;ll be no rent to pay and
no novelettes to write.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She had a feminine gift for delicate flattery. She thought that Philip did a
brave thing when he left Paris because he was conscious he could not be a great
artist; and he was enchanted when she expressed enthusiastic admiration for
him. He had never been quite certain whether this action indicated courage or
infirmity of purpose. It was delightful to realise that she considered it
heroic. She ventured to tackle him on a subject which his friends instinctively
avoided.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very silly of you to be so sensitive about your
club-foot,&rdquo; she said. She saw him blush darkly, but went on. &ldquo;You
know, people don&rsquo;t think about it nearly as much as you do. They notice
it the first time they see you, and then they forget about it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He would not answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not angry with me, are you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She put her arm round his neck.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know, I only speak about it because I love you. I don&rsquo;t want
it to make you unhappy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you can say anything you choose to me,&rdquo; he answered,
smiling. &ldquo;I wish I could do something to show you how grateful I am to
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She took him in hand in other ways. She would not let him be bearish and
laughed at him when he was out of temper. She made him more urbane.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can make me do anything you like,&rdquo; he said to her once.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you mind?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I want to do what you like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had the sense to realise his happiness. It seemed to him that she gave him
all that a wife could, and he preserved his freedom; she was the most charming
friend he had ever had, with a sympathy that he had never found in a man. The
sexual relationship was no more than the strongest link in their friendship. It
completed it, but was not essential. And because Philip&rsquo;s appetites were
satisfied, he became more equable and easier to live with. He felt in complete
possession of himself. He thought sometimes of the winter, during which he had
been obsessed by a hideous passion, and he was filled with loathing for Mildred
and with horror of himself.
</p>

<p>
His examinations were approaching, and Norah was as interested in them as he.
He was flattered and touched by her eagerness. She made him promise to come at
once and tell her the results. He passed the three parts this time without
mishap, and when he went to tell her she burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad, I was so anxious.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You silly little thing,&rdquo; he laughed, but he was choking.
</p>

<p>
No one could help being pleased with the way she took it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what are you going to do now?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can take a holiday with a clear conscience. I have no work to do till
the winter session begins in October.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll go down to your uncle&rsquo;s at
Blackstable?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You suppose quite wrong. I&rsquo;m going to stay in London and play with
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather you went away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why? Are you tired of me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She laughed and put her hands on his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;ve been working hard, and you look utterly washed out.
You want some fresh air and a rest. Please go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He did not answer for a moment. He looked at her with loving eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;d never believe it of anyone but you. You&rsquo;re
only thinking of my good. I wonder what you see in me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you give me a good character with my month&rsquo;s notice?&rdquo;
she laughed gaily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say that you&rsquo;re thoughtful and kind, and you&rsquo;re
not exacting; you never worry, you&rsquo;re not troublesome, and you&rsquo;re
easy to please.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All that&rsquo;s nonsense,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll tell
you one thing: I&rsquo;m one of the few persons I ever met who are able to
learn from experience.&rdquo;
</p>

<h2>LXVII</h2>

<p>
Philip looked forward to his return to London with impatience. During the two
months he spent at Blackstable Norah wrote to him frequently, long letters in a
bold, large hand, in which with cheerful humour she described the little events
of the daily round, the domestic troubles of her landlady, rich food for
laughter, the comic vexations of her rehearsals&mdash;she was walking on in an
important spectacle at one of the London theatres&mdash;and her odd adventures
with the publishers of novelettes. Philip read a great deal, bathed, played
tennis, and sailed. At the beginning of October he settled down in London to
work for the Second Conjoint examination. He was eager to pass it, since that
ended the drudgery of the curriculum; after it was done with the student became
an out-patients&rsquo; clerk, and was brought in contact with men and women as
well as with text-books. Philip saw Norah every day.
</p>

<p>
Lawson had been spending the summer at Poole, and had a number of sketches to
show of the harbour and of the beach. He had a couple of commissions for
portraits and proposed to stay in London till the bad light drove him away.
Hayward, in London too, intended to spend the winter abroad, but remained week
after week from sheer inability to make up his mind to go. Hayward had run to
fat during the last two or three years&mdash;it was five years since Philip
first met him in Heidelberg&mdash;and he was prematurely bald. He was very
sensitive about it and wore his hair long to conceal the unsightly patch on the
crown of his head. His only consolation was that his brow was now very noble.
His blue eyes had lost their colour; they had a listless droop; and his mouth,
losing the fulness of youth, was weak and pale. He still talked vaguely of the
things he was going to do in the future, but with less conviction; and he was
conscious that his friends no longer believed in him: when he had drank two or
three glasses of whiskey he was inclined to be elegiac.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a failure,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m unfit for the
brutality of the struggle of life. All I can do is to stand aside and let the
vulgar throng hustle by in their pursuit of the good things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He gave you the impression that to fail was a more delicate, a more exquisite
thing, than to succeed. He insinuated that his aloofness was due to distaste
for all that was common and low. He talked beautifully of Plato.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should have thought you&rsquo;d got through with Plato by now,&rdquo;
said Philip impatiently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would you?&rdquo; he asked, raising his eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
He was not inclined to pursue the subject. He had discovered of late the
effective dignity of silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the use of reading the same thing over and over
again,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s only a laborious form of
idleness.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But are you under the impression that you have so great a mind that you
can understand the most profound writer at a first reading?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to understand him, I&rsquo;m not a critic. I&rsquo;m
not interested in him for his sake but for mine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why d&rsquo;you read then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Partly for pleasure, because it&rsquo;s a habit and I&rsquo;m just as
uncomfortable if I don&rsquo;t read as if I don&rsquo;t smoke, and partly to
know myself. When I read a book I seem to read it with my eyes only, but now
and then I come across a passage, perhaps only a phrase, which has a meaning
for ME, and it becomes part of me; I&rsquo;ve got out of the book all
that&rsquo;s any use to me, and I can&rsquo;t get anything more if I read it a
dozen times. You see, it seems to me, one&rsquo;s like a closed bud, and most
of what one reads and does has no effect at all; but there are certain things
that have a peculiar significance for one, and they open a petal; and the
petals open one by one; and at last the flower is there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was not satisfied with his metaphor, but he did not know how else to
explain a thing which he felt and yet was not clear about.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You want to do things, you want to become things,&rdquo; said Hayward,
with a shrug of the shoulders. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so vulgar.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip knew Hayward very well by now. He was weak and vain, so vain that you
had to be on the watch constantly not to hurt his feelings; he mingled idleness
and idealism so that he could not separate them. At Lawson&rsquo;s studio one
day he met a journalist, who was charmed by his conversation, and a week later
the editor of a paper wrote to suggest that he should do some criticism for
him. For forty-eight hours Hayward lived in an agony of indecision. He had
talked of getting occupation of this sort so long that he had not the face to
refuse outright, but the thought of doing anything filled him with panic. At
last he declined the offer and breathed freely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It would have interfered with my work,&rdquo; he told Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What work?&rdquo; asked Philip brutally.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My inner life,&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
Then he went on to say beautiful things about Amiel, the professor of Geneva,
whose brilliancy promised achievement which was never fulfilled; till at his
death the reason of his failure and the excuse were at once manifest in the
minute, wonderful journal which was found among his papers. Hayward smiled
enigmatically.
</p>

<p>
But Hayward could still talk delightfully about books; his taste was exquisite
and his discrimination elegant; and he had a constant interest in ideas, which
made him an entertaining companion. They meant nothing to him really, since
they never had any effect on him; but he treated them as he might have pieces
of china in an auction-room, handling them with pleasure in their shape and
their glaze, pricing them in his mind; and then, putting them back into their
case, thought of them no more.
</p>

<p>
And it was Hayward who made a momentous discovery. One evening, after due
preparation, he took Philip and Lawson to a tavern situated in Beak Street,
remarkable not only in itself and for its history&mdash;it had memories of
eighteenth-century glories which excited the romantic imagination&mdash;but for
its snuff, which was the best in London, and above all for its punch. Hayward
led them into a large, long room, dingily magnificent, with huge pictures on
the walls of nude women: they were vast allegories of the school of Haydon; but
smoke, gas, and the London atmosphere had given them a richness which made them
look like old masters. The dark panelling, the massive, tarnished gold of the
cornice, the mahogany tables, gave the room an air of sumptuous comfort, and
the leather-covered seats along the wall were soft and easy. There was a
ram&rsquo;s head on a table opposite the door, and this contained the
celebrated snuff. They ordered punch. They drank it. It was hot rum punch. The
pen falters when it attempts to treat of the excellence thereof; the sober
vocabulary, the sparse epithet of this narrative, are inadequate to the task;
and pompous terms, jewelled, exotic phrases rise to the excited fancy. It
warmed the blood and cleared the head; it filled the soul with well-being; it
disposed the mind at once to utter wit and to appreciate the wit of others; it
had the vagueness of music and the precision of mathematics. Only one of its
qualities was comparable to anything else: it had the warmth of a good heart;
but its taste, its smell, its feel, were not to be described in words. Charles
Lamb, with his infinite tact, attempting to, might have drawn charming pictures
of the life of his day; Lord Byron in a stanza of Don Juan, aiming at the
impossible, might have achieved the sublime; Oscar Wilde, heaping jewels of
Ispahan upon brocades of Byzantium, might have created a troubling beauty.
Considering it, the mind reeled under visions of the feasts of Elagabalus; and
the subtle harmonies of Debussy mingled with the musty, fragrant romance of
chests in which have been kept old clothes, ruffs, hose, doublets, of a
forgotten generation, and the wan odour of lilies of the valley and the savour
of Cheddar cheese.
</p>

<p>
Hayward discovered the tavern at which this priceless beverage was to be
obtained by meeting in the street a man called Macalister who had been at
Cambridge with him. He was a stockbroker and a philosopher. He was accustomed
to go to the tavern once a week; and soon Philip, Lawson, and Hayward got into
the habit of meeting there every Tuesday evening: change of manners made it now
little frequented, which was an advantage to persons who took pleasure in
conversation. Macalister was a big-boned fellow, much too short for his width,
with a large, fleshy face and a soft voice. He was a student of Kant and judged
everything from the standpoint of pure reason. He was fond of expounding his
doctrines. Philip listened with excited interest. He had long come to the
conclusion that nothing amused him more than metaphysics, but he was not so
sure of their efficacy in the affairs of life. The neat little system which he
had formed as the result of his meditations at Blackstable had not been of
conspicuous use during his infatuation for Mildred. He could not be positive
that reason was much help in the conduct of life. It seemed to him that life
lived itself. He remembered very vividly the violence of the emotion which had
possessed him and his inability, as if he were tied down to the ground with
ropes, to react against it. He read many wise things in books, but he could
only judge from his own experience (he did not know whether he was different
from other people); he did not calculate the pros and cons of an action, the
benefits which must befall him if he did it, the harm which might result from
the omission; but his whole being was urged on irresistibly. He did not act
with a part of himself but altogether. The power that possessed him seemed to
have nothing to do with reason: all that reason did was to point out the
methods of obtaining what his whole soul was striving for.
</p>

<p>
Macalister reminded him of the Categorical Imperative.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Act so that every action of yours should be capable of becoming a
universal rule of action for all men.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That seems to me perfect nonsense,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bold man to say that of anything stated by Immanuel
Kant,&rdquo; retorted Macalister.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why? Reverence for what somebody said is a stultifying quality:
there&rsquo;s a damned sight too much reverence in the world. Kant thought
things not because they were true, but because he was Kant.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what is your objection to the Categorical Imperative?&rdquo; (They
talked as though the fate of empires were in the balance.)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It suggests that one can choose one&rsquo;s course by an effort of will.
And it suggests that reason is the surest guide. Why should its dictates be any
better than those of passion? They&rsquo;re different. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You seem to be a contented slave of your passions.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A slave because I can&rsquo;t help myself, but not a contented
one,&rdquo; laughed Philip.
</p>

<p>
While he spoke he thought of that hot madness which had driven him in pursuit
of Mildred. He remembered how he had chafed against it and how he had felt the
degradation of it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank God, I&rsquo;m free from all that now,&rdquo; he thought.
</p>

<p>
And yet even as he said it he was not quite sure whether he spoke sincerely.
When he was under the influence of passion he had felt a singular vigour, and
his mind had worked with unwonted force. He was more alive, there was an
excitement in sheer being, an eager vehemence of soul, which made life now a
trifle dull. For all the misery he had endured there was a compensation in that
sense of rushing, overwhelming existence.
</p>

<p>
But Philip&rsquo;s unlucky words engaged him in a discussion on the freedom of
the will, and Macalister, with his well-stored memory, brought out argument
after argument. He had a mind that delighted in dialectics, and he forced
Philip to contradict himself; he pushed him into corners from which he could
only escape by damaging concessions; he tripped him up with logic and battered
him with authorities.
</p>

<p>
At last Philip said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t say anything about other people. I can only speak
for myself. The illusion of free will is so strong in my mind that I
can&rsquo;t get away from it, but I believe it is only an illusion. But it is
an illusion which is one of the strongest motives of my actions. Before I do
anything I feel that I have choice, and that influences what I do; but
afterwards, when the thing is done, I believe that it was inevitable from all
eternity.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you deduce from that?&rdquo; asked Hayward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, merely the futility of regret. It&rsquo;s no good crying over spilt
milk, because all the forces of the universe were bent on spilling it.&rdquo;

<h2>LXVIII</h2>

<p>
One morning Philip on getting up felt his head swim, and going back to bed
suddenly discovered he was ill. All his limbs ached and he shivered with cold.
When the landlady brought in his breakfast he called to her through the open
door that he was not well, and asked for a cup of tea and a piece of toast. A
few minutes later there was a knock at his door, and Griffiths came in. They
had lived in the same house for over a year, but had never done more than nod
to one another in the passage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, I hear you&rsquo;re seedy,&rdquo; said Griffiths. &ldquo;I
thought I&rsquo;d come in and see what was the matter with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip, blushing he knew not why, made light of the whole thing. He would be
all right in an hour or two.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d better let me take your temperature,&rdquo; said
Griffiths.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite unnecessary,&rdquo; answered Philip irritably.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip put the thermometer in his mouth. Griffiths sat on the side of the bed
and chatted brightly for a moment, then he took it out and looked at it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, look here, old man, you must stay in bed, and I&rsquo;ll bring old
Deacon in to have a look at you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing the matter. I
wish you wouldn&rsquo;t bother about me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t any bother. You&rsquo;ve got a temperature and you
must stay in bed. You will, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a peculiar charm in his manner, a mingling of gravity and kindliness,
which was infinitely attractive.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a wonderful bed-side manner,&rdquo; Philip murmured,
closing his eyes with a smile.
</p>

<p>
Griffiths shook out his pillow for him, deftly smoothed down the bedclothes,
and tucked him up. He went into Philip&rsquo;s sitting-room to look for a
siphon, could not find one, and fetched it from his own room. He drew down the
blind.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, go to sleep and I&rsquo;ll bring the old man round as soon as
he&rsquo;s done the wards.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It seemed hours before anyone came to Philip. His head felt as if it would
split, anguish rent his limbs, and he was afraid he was going to cry. Then
there was a knock at the door and Griffiths, healthy, strong, and cheerful,
came in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Doctor Deacon,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
The physician stepped forward, an elderly man with a bland manner, whom Philip
knew only by sight. A few questions, a brief examination, and the diagnosis.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you make it?&rdquo; he asked Griffiths, smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Influenza.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Doctor Deacon looked round the dingy lodging-house room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to go to the hospital? They&rsquo;ll put you in
a private ward, and you can be better looked after than you can here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather stay where I am,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
He did not want to be disturbed, and he was always shy of new surroundings. He
did not fancy nurses fussing about him, and the dreary cleanliness of the
hospital.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can look after him, sir,&rdquo; said Griffiths at once.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, very well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He wrote a prescription, gave instructions, and left.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve got to do exactly as I tell you,&rdquo; said Griffiths.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m day-nurse and night-nurse all in one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you, but I shan&rsquo;t want anything,&rdquo;
said Philip.
</p>

<p>
Griffiths put his hand on Philip&rsquo;s forehead, a large cool, dry hand, and
the touch seemed to him good.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to take this round to the dispensary to have it
made up, and then I&rsquo;ll come back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In a little while he brought the medicine and gave Philip a dose. Then he went
upstairs to fetch his books.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t mind my working in your room this afternoon, will
you?&rdquo; he said, when he came down. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave the door open
so that you can give me a shout if you want anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Later in the day Philip, awaking from an uneasy doze, heard voices in his
sitting-room. A friend had come in to see Griffiths.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, you&rsquo;d better not come in tonight,&rdquo; he heard Griffiths
saying.
</p>

<p>
And then a minute or two afterwards someone else entered the room and expressed
his surprise at finding Griffiths there. Philip heard him explain.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking after a second year&rsquo;s man who&rsquo;s got these
rooms. The wretched blighter&rsquo;s down with influenza. No whist tonight, old
man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Presently Griffiths was left alone and Philip called him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, you&rsquo;re not putting off a party tonight, are you?&rdquo; he
asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not on your account. I must work at my surgery.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put it off. I shall be all right. You needn&rsquo;t bother
about me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip grew worse. As the night came on he became slightly delirious, but
towards morning he awoke from a restless sleep. He saw Griffiths get out of an
arm-chair, go down on his knees, and with his fingers put piece after piece of
coal on the fire. He was in pyjamas and a dressing-gown.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did I wake you up? I tried to make up the fire without making a
row.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you in bed? What&rsquo;s the time?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;About five. I thought I&rsquo;d better sit up with you tonight. I
brought an arm-chair in as I thought if I put a mattress down I should sleep so
soundly that I shouldn&rsquo;t hear you if you wanted anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t be so good to me,&rdquo; groaned Philip.
&ldquo;Suppose you catch it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you shall nurse me, old man,&rdquo; said Griffiths, with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
In the morning Griffiths drew up the blind. He looked pale and tired after his
night&rsquo;s watch, but was full of spirits.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;m going to wash you,&rdquo; he said to Philip cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can wash myself,&rdquo; said Philip, ashamed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense. If you were in the small ward a nurse would wash you, and I
can do it just as well as a nurse.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip, too weak and wretched to resist, allowed Griffiths to wash his hands
and face, his feet, his chest and back. He did it with charming tenderness,
carrying on meanwhile a stream of friendly chatter; then he changed the sheet
just as they did at the hospital, shook out the pillow, and arranged the
bed-clothes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should like Sister Arthur to see me. It would make her sit up.
Deacon&rsquo;s coming in to see you early.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine why you should be so good to me,&rdquo; said
Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good practice for me. It&rsquo;s rather a lark having a
patient.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Griffiths gave him his breakfast and went off to get dressed and have something
to eat. A few minutes before ten he came back with a bunch of grapes and a few
flowers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are awfully kind,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
He was in bed for five days.
</p>

<p>
Norah and Griffiths nursed him between them. Though Griffiths was the same age
as Philip he adopted towards him a humorous, motherly attitude. He was a
thoughtful fellow, gentle and encouraging; but his greatest quality was a
vitality which seemed to give health to everyone with whom he came in contact.
Philip was unused to the petting which most people enjoy from mothers or
sisters and he was deeply touched by the feminine tenderness of this strong
young man. Philip grew better. Then Griffiths, sitting idly in Philip&rsquo;s
room, amused him with gay stories of amorous adventure. He was a flirtatious
creature, capable of carrying on three or four affairs at a time; and his
account of the devices he was forced to in order to keep out of difficulties
made excellent hearing. He had a gift for throwing a romantic glamour over
everything that happened to him. He was crippled with debts, everything he had
of any value was pawned, but he managed always to be cheerful, extravagant, and
generous. He was the adventurer by nature. He loved people of doubtful
occupations and shifty purposes; and his acquaintance among the riff-raff that
frequents the bars of London was enormous. Loose women, treating him as a
friend, told him the troubles, difficulties, and successes of their lives; and
card-sharpers, respecting his impecuniosity, stood him dinners and lent him
five-pound notes. He was ploughed in his examinations time after time; but he
bore this cheerfully, and submitted with such a charming grace to the parental
expostulations that his father, a doctor in practice at Leeds, had not the
heart to be seriously angry with him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an awful fool at books,&rdquo; he said cheerfully, &ldquo;but
I CAN&rsquo;T work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Life was much too jolly. But it was clear that when he had got through the
exuberance of his youth, and was at last qualified, he would be a tremendous
success in practice. He would cure people by the sheer charm of his manner.
</p>

<p>
Philip worshipped him as at school he had worshipped boys who were tall and
straight and high of spirits. By the time he was well they were fast friends,
and it was a peculiar satisfaction to Philip that Griffiths seemed to enjoy
sitting in his little parlour, wasting Philip&rsquo;s time with his amusing
chatter and smoking innumerable cigarettes. Philip took him sometimes to the
tavern off Regent Street. Hayward found him stupid, but Lawson recognised his
charm and was eager to paint him; he was a picturesque figure with his blue
eyes, white skin, and curly hair. Often they discussed things he knew nothing
about, and then he sat quietly, with a good-natured smile on his handsome face,
feeling quite rightly that his presence was sufficient contribution to the
entertainment of the company. When he discovered that Macalister was a
stockbroker he was eager for tips; and Macalister, with his grave smile, told
him what fortunes he could have made if he had bought certain stock at certain
times. It made Philip&rsquo;s mouth water, for in one way and another he was
spending more than he had expected, and it would have suited him very well to
make a little money by the easy method Macalister suggested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Next time I hear of a really good thing I&rsquo;ll let you know,&rdquo;
said the stockbroker. &ldquo;They do come along sometimes. It&rsquo;s only a
matter of biding one&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip could not help thinking how delightful it would be to make fifty pounds,
so that he could give Norah the furs she so badly needed for the winter. He
looked at the shops in Regent Street and picked out the articles he could buy
for the money. She deserved everything. She made his life very happy.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>LXIX</h2>

<p>
One afternoon, when he went back to his rooms from the hospital to wash and
tidy himself before going to tea as usual with Norah, as he let himself in with
his latch-key, his landlady opened the door for him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lady waiting to see you,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; exclaimed Philip.
</p>

<p>
He was surprised. It would only be Norah, and he had no idea what had brought
her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave let her in, only she&rsquo;s been three
times, and she seemed that upset at not finding you, so I told her she could
wait.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He pushed past the explaining landlady and burst into the room. His heart
turned sick. It was Mildred. She was sitting down, but got up hurriedly as he
came in. She did not move towards him nor speak. He was so surprised that he
did not know what he was saying.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What the hell d&rsquo;you want?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
She did not answer, but began to cry. She did not put her hands to her eyes,
but kept them hanging by the side of her body. She looked like a housemaid
applying for a situation. There was a dreadful humility in her bearing. Philip
did not know what feelings came over him. He had a sudden impulse to turn round
and escape from the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d ever see you again,&rdquo; he said at
last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish I was dead,&rdquo; she moaned.
</p>

<p>
Philip left her standing where she was. He could only think at the moment of
steadying himself. His knees were shaking. He looked at her, and he groaned in
despair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s left me&mdash;Emil.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip&rsquo;s heart bounded. He knew then that he loved her as passionately as
ever. He had never ceased to love her. She was standing before him humble and
unresisting. He wished to take her in his arms and cover her tear-stained face
with kisses. Oh, how long the separation had been! He did not know how he could
have endured it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better sit down. Let me give you a drink.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He drew the chair near the fire and she sat in it. He mixed her whiskey and
soda, and, sobbing still, she drank it. She looked at him with great, mournful
eyes. There were large black lines under them. She was thinner and whiter than
when last he had seen her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d married you when you asked me,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
Philip did not know why the remark seemed to swell his heart. He could not keep
the distance from her which he had forced upon himself. He put his hand on her
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry you&rsquo;re in trouble.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She leaned her head against his bosom and burst into hysterical crying. Her hat
was in the way and she took it off. He had never dreamt that she was capable of
crying like that. He kissed her again and again. It seemed to ease her a
little.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You were always good to me, Philip,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
why I knew I could come to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me what&rsquo;s happened.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she cried out, breaking away
from him.
</p>

<p>
He sank down on his knees beside her and put his cheek against hers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that there&rsquo;s nothing you can&rsquo;t tell me?
I can never blame you for anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She told him the story little by little, and sometimes she sobbed so much that
he could hardly understand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Last Monday week he went up to Birmingham, and he promised to be back on
Thursday, and he never came, and he didn&rsquo;t come on the Friday, so I wrote
to ask what was the matter, and he never answered the letter. And I wrote and
said that if I didn&rsquo;t hear from him by return I&rsquo;d go up to
Birmingham, and this morning I got a solicitor&rsquo;s letter to say I had no
claim on him, and if I molested him he&rsquo;d seek the protection of the
law.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s absurd,&rdquo; cried Philip. &ldquo;A man can&rsquo;t
treat his wife like that. Had you had a row?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes, we&rsquo;d had a quarrel on the Sunday, and he said he was sick
of me, but he&rsquo;d said it before, and he&rsquo;d come back all right. I
didn&rsquo;t think he meant it. He was frightened, because I told him a baby
was coming. I kept it from him as long as I could. Then I had to tell him. He
said it was my fault, and I ought to have known better. If you&rsquo;d only
heard the things he said to me! But I found out precious quick that he
wasn&rsquo;t a gentleman. He left me without a penny. He hadn&rsquo;t paid the
rent, and I hadn&rsquo;t got the money to pay it, and the woman who kept the
house said such things to me&mdash;well, I might have been a thief the way she
talked.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought you were going to take a flat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he said, but we just took furnished apartments in
Highbury. He was that mean. He said I was extravagant, he didn&rsquo;t give me
anything to be extravagant with.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She had an extraordinary way of mixing the trivial with the important. Philip
was puzzled. The whole thing was incomprehensible.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No man could be such a blackguard.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know him. I wouldn&rsquo;t go back to him now not if he
was to come and ask me on his bended knees. I was a fool ever to think of him.
And he wasn&rsquo;t earning the money he said he was. The lies he told
me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip thought for a minute or two. He was so deeply moved by her distress that
he could not think of himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would you like me to go to Birmingham? I could see him and try to make
things up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s no chance of that. He&rsquo;ll never come back now, I
know him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But he must provide for you. He can&rsquo;t get out of that. I
don&rsquo;t know anything about these things, you&rsquo;d better go and see a
solicitor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can I? I haven&rsquo;t got the money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay all that. I&rsquo;ll write a note to my own solicitor,
the sportsman who was my father&rsquo;s executor. Would you like me to come
with you now? I expect he&rsquo;ll still be at his office.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, give me a letter to him. I&rsquo;ll go alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She was a little calmer now. He sat down and wrote a note. Then he remembered
that she had no money. He had fortunately changed a cheque the day before and
was able to give her five pounds.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are good to me, Philip,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy to be able to do something for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you fond of me still?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just as fond as ever.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She put up her lips and he kissed her. There was a surrender in the action
which he had never seen in her before. It was worth all the agony he had
suffered.
</p>

<p>
She went away and he found that she had been there for two hours. He was
extraordinarily happy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor thing, poor thing,&rdquo; he murmured to himself, his heart glowing
with a greater love than he had ever felt before.
</p>

<p>
He never thought of Norah at all till about eight o&rsquo;clock a telegram
came. He knew before opening it that it was from her.
</p>

<p>
Is anything the matter? Norah.
</p>

<p>
He did not know what to do nor what to answer. He could fetch her after the
play, in which she was walking on, was over and stroll home with her as he
sometimes did; but his whole soul revolted against the idea of seeing her that
evening. He thought of writing to her, but he could not bring himself to
address her as usual, dearest Norah. He made up his mind to telegraph.
</p>

<p>
Sorry. Could not get away, Philip.
</p>

<p>
He visualised her. He was slightly repelled by the ugly little face, with its
high cheekbones and the crude colour. There was a coarseness in her skin which
gave him goose-flesh. He knew that his telegram must be followed by some action
on his part, but at all events it postponed it.
</p>

<p>
Next day he wired again.
</p>

<p>
Regret, unable to come. Will write.
</p>

<p>
Mildred had suggested coming at four in the afternoon, and he would not tell
her that the hour was inconvenient. After all she came first. He waited for her
impatiently. He watched for her at the window and opened the front-door
himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well? Did you see Nixon?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;He said it wasn&rsquo;t any good.
Nothing&rsquo;s to be done. I must just grin and bear it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; cried Philip.
</p>

<p>
She sat down wearily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did he give any reasons?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
She gave him a crumpled letter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your letter, Philip. I never took it. I couldn&rsquo;t
tell you yesterday, I really couldn&rsquo;t. Emil didn&rsquo;t marry me. He
couldn&rsquo;t. He had a wife already and three children.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip felt a sudden pang of jealousy and anguish. It was almost more than he
could bear.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I couldn&rsquo;t go back to my aunt. There&rsquo;s no
one I can go to but you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What made you go away with him?&rdquo; Philip asked, in a low voice
which he struggled to make firm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I didn&rsquo;t know he was a married man at first,
and when he told me I gave him a piece of my mind. And then I didn&rsquo;t see
him for months, and when he came to the shop again and asked me I don&rsquo;t
know what came over me. I felt as if I couldn&rsquo;t help it. I had to go with
him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Were you in love with him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I couldn&rsquo;t hardly help laughing at the things
he said. And there was something about him&mdash;he said I&rsquo;d never regret
it, he promised to give me seven pounds a week&mdash;he said he was earning
fifteen, and it was all a lie, he wasn&rsquo;t. And then I was sick of going to
the shop every morning, and I wasn&rsquo;t getting on very well with my aunt;
she wanted to treat me as a servant instead of a relation, said I ought to do
my own room, and if I didn&rsquo;t do it nobody was going to do it for me. Oh,
I wish I hadn&rsquo;t. But when he came to the shop and asked me I felt I
couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip moved away from her. He sat down at the table and buried his face in his
hands. He felt dreadfully humiliated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not angry with me, Philip?&rdquo; she asked piteously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, looking up but away from her, &ldquo;only
I&rsquo;m awfully hurt.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see, I was so dreadfully in love with you. I did everything I could
to make you care for me. I thought you were incapable of loving anyone.
It&rsquo;s so horrible to know that you were willing to sacrifice everything
for that bounder. I wonder what you saw in him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, Philip. I regretted it bitterly afterwards, I
promise you that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He thought of Emil Miller, with his pasty, unhealthy look, his shifty blue
eyes, and the vulgar smartness of his appearance; he always wore bright red
knitted waistcoats. Philip sighed. She got up and went to him. She put her arm
round his neck.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall never forget that you offered to marry me, Philip.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He took her hand and looked up at her. She bent down and kissed him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Philip, if you want me still I&rsquo;ll do anything you like now. I know
you&rsquo;re a gentleman in every sense of the word.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His heart stood still. Her words made him feel slightly sick.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully good of you, but I couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you care for me any more?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I love you with all my heart.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then why shouldn&rsquo;t we have a good time while we&rsquo;ve got the
chance? You see, it can&rsquo;t matter now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He released himself from her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand. I&rsquo;ve been sick with love for you ever
since I saw you, but now&mdash;that man. I&rsquo;ve unfortunately got a vivid
imagination. The thought of it simply disgusts me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are funny,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
He took her hand again and smiled at her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m not grateful. I can never thank you
enough, but you see, it&rsquo;s just stronger than I am.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are a good friend, Philip.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They went on talking, and soon they had returned to the familiar companionship
of old days. It grew late. Philip suggested that they should dine together and
go to a music-hall. She wanted some persuasion, for she had an idea of acting
up to her situation, and felt instinctively that it did not accord with her
distressed condition to go to a place of entertainment. At last Philip asked
her to go simply to please him, and when she could look upon it as an act of
self-sacrifice she accepted. She had a new thoughtfulness which delighted
Philip. She asked him to take her to the little restaurant in Soho to which
they had so often been; he was infinitely grateful to her, because her
suggestion showed that happy memories were attached to it. She grew much more
cheerful as dinner proceeded. The Burgundy from the public house at the corner
warmed her heart, and she forgot that she ought to preserve a dolorous
countenance. Philip thought it safe to speak to her of the future.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you haven&rsquo;t got a brass farthing, have you?&rdquo; he
asked, when an opportunity presented itself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only what you gave me yesterday, and I had to give the landlady three
pounds of that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d better give you a tenner to go on with. I&rsquo;ll go
and see my solicitor and get him to write to Miller. We can make him pay up
something, I&rsquo;m sure. If we can get a hundred pounds out of him
it&rsquo;ll carry you on till after the baby comes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t take a penny from him. I&rsquo;d rather starve.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s monstrous that he should leave you in the lurch like
this.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my pride to consider.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was a little awkward for Philip. He needed rigid economy to make his own
money last till he was qualified, and he must have something over to keep him
during the year he intended to spend as house physician and house surgeon
either at his own or at some other hospital. But Mildred had told him various
stories of Emil&rsquo;s meanness, and he was afraid to remonstrate with her in
case she accused him too of want of generosity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t take a penny piece from him. I&rsquo;d sooner beg my
bread. I&rsquo;d have seen about getting some work to do long before now, only
it wouldn&rsquo;t be good for me in the state I&rsquo;m in. You have to think
of your health, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t bother about the present,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;I
can let you have all you want till you&rsquo;re fit to work again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I knew I could depend on you. I told Emil he needn&rsquo;t think I
hadn&rsquo;t got somebody to go to. I told him you was a gentleman in every
sense of the word.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
By degrees Philip learned how the separation had come about. It appeared that
the fellow&rsquo;s wife had discovered the adventure he was engaged in during
his periodical visits to London, and had gone to the head of the firm that
employed him. She threatened to divorce him, and they announced that they would
dismiss him if she did. He was passionately devoted to his children and could
not bear the thought of being separated from them. When he had to choose
between his wife and his mistress he chose his wife. He had been always anxious
that there should be no child to make the entanglement more complicated; and
when Mildred, unable longer to conceal its approach, informed him of the fact,
he was seized with panic. He picked a quarrel and left her without more ado.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When d&rsquo;you expect to be confined?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At the beginning of March.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Three months.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was necessary to discuss plans. Mildred declared she would not remain in the
rooms at Highbury, and Philip thought it more convenient too that she should be
nearer to him. He promised to look for something next day. She suggested the
Vauxhall Bridge Road as a likely neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And it would be near for afterwards,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I should only be able to stay there about two months or a little
more, and then I should have to go into a house. I know a very respectable
place, where they have a most superior class of people, and they take you for
four guineas a week and no extras. Of course the doctor&rsquo;s extra, but
that&rsquo;s all. A friend of mine went there, and the lady who keeps it is a
thorough lady. I mean to tell her that my husband&rsquo;s an officer in India
and I&rsquo;ve come to London for my baby, because it&rsquo;s better for my
health.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It seemed extraordinary to Philip to hear her talking in this way. With her
delicate little features and her pale face she looked cold and maidenly. When
he thought of the passions that burnt within her, so unexpected, his heart was
strangely troubled. His pulse beat quickly.
</p>

<h2>LXX</h2>

<p>
Philip expected to find a letter from Norah when he got back to his rooms, but
there was nothing; nor did he receive one the following morning. The silence
irritated and at the same time alarmed him. They had seen one another every day
he had been in London since the previous June; and it must seem odd to her that
he should let two days go by without visiting her or offering a reason for his
absence; he wondered whether by an unlucky chance she had seen him with
Mildred. He could not bear to think that she was hurt or unhappy, and he made
up his mind to call on her that afternoon. He was almost inclined to reproach
her because he had allowed himself to get on such intimate terms with her. The
thought of continuing them filled him with disgust.
</p>

<p>
He found two rooms for Mildred on the second floor of a house in the Vauxhall
Bridge Road. They were noisy, but he knew that she liked the rattle of traffic
under her windows.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like a dead and alive street where you don&rsquo;t see a
soul pass all day,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Give me a bit of life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then he forced himself to go to Vincent Square. He was sick with apprehension
when he rang the bell. He had an uneasy sense that he was treating Norah badly;
he dreaded reproaches; he knew she had a quick temper, and he hated scenes:
perhaps the best way would be to tell her frankly that Mildred had come back to
him and his love for her was as violent as it had ever been; he was very sorry,
but he had nothing to offer Norah any more. Then he thought of her anguish, for
he knew she loved him; it had flattered him before, and he was immensely
grateful; but now it was horrible. She had not deserved that he should inflict
pain upon her. He asked himself how she would greet him now, and as he walked
up the stairs all possible forms of her behaviour flashed across his mind. He
knocked at the door. He felt that he was pale, and wondered how to conceal his
nervousness.
</p>

<p>
She was writing away industriously, but she sprang to her feet as he entered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I recognised your step,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Where have you been
hiding yourself, you naughty boy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She came towards him joyfully and put her arms round his neck. She was
delighted to see him. He kissed her, and then, to give himself countenance,
said he was dying for tea. She bustled the fire to make the kettle boil.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been awfully busy,&rdquo; he said lamely.
</p>

<p>
She began to chatter in her bright way, telling him of a new commission she had
to provide a novelette for a firm which had not hitherto employed her. She was
to get fifteen guineas for it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s money from the clouds. I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll
do, we&rsquo;ll stand ourselves a little jaunt. Let&rsquo;s go and spend a day
at Oxford, shall we? I&rsquo;d love to see the colleges.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked at her to see whether there was any shadow of reproach in her eyes;
but they were as frank and merry as ever: she was overjoyed to see him. His
heart sank. He could not tell her the brutal truth. She made some toast for
him, and cut it into little pieces, and gave it him as though he were a child.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is the brute fed?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
He nodded, smiling; and she lit a cigarette for him. Then, as she loved to do,
she came and sat on his knees. She was very light. She leaned back in his arms
with a sigh of delicious happiness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Say something nice to me,&rdquo; she murmured.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What shall I say?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You might by an effort of imagination say that you rather liked
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know I do that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had not the heart to tell her then. He would give her peace at all events
for that day, and perhaps he might write to her. That would be easier. He could
not bear to think of her crying. She made him kiss her, and as he kissed her he
thought of Mildred and Mildred&rsquo;s pale, thin lips. The recollection of
Mildred remained with him all the time, like an incorporated form, but more
substantial than a shadow; and the sight continually distracted his attention.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very quiet today,&rdquo; Norah said.
</p>

<p>
Her loquacity was a standing joke between them, and he answered:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You never let me get a word in, and I&rsquo;ve got out of the habit of
talking.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not listening, and that&rsquo;s bad manners.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He reddened a little, wondering whether she had some inkling of his secret; he
turned away his eyes uneasily. The weight of her irked him this afternoon, and
he did not want her to touch him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My foot&rsquo;s gone to sleep,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; she cried, jumping up. &ldquo;I shall have to
bant if I can&rsquo;t break myself of this habit of sitting on
gentlemen&rsquo;s knees.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He went through an elaborate form of stamping his foot and walking about. Then
he stood in front of the fire so that she should not resume her position. While
she talked he thought that she was worth ten of Mildred; she amused him much
more and was jollier to talk to; she was cleverer, and she had a much nicer
nature. She was a good, brave, honest little woman; and Mildred, he thought
bitterly, deserved none of these epithets. If he had any sense he would stick
to Norah, she would make him much happier than he would ever be with Mildred:
after all she loved him, and Mildred was only grateful for his help. But when
all was said the important thing was to love rather than to be loved; and he
yearned for Mildred with his whole soul. He would sooner have ten minutes with
her than a whole afternoon with Norah, he prized one kiss of her cold lips more
than all Norah could give him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help myself,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just got
her in my bones.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He did not care if she was heartless, vicious and vulgar, stupid and grasping,
he loved her. He would rather have misery with the one than happiness with the
other.
</p>

<p>
When he got up to go Norah said casually:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I shall see you tomorrow, shan&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
He knew that he would not be able to come, since he was going to help Mildred
with her moving, but he had not the courage to say so. He made up his mind that
he would send a wire. Mildred saw the rooms in the morning, was satisfied with
them, and after luncheon Philip went up with her to Highbury. She had a trunk
for her clothes and another for the various odds and ends, cushions,
lampshades, photograph frames, with which she had tried to give the apartments
a home-like air; she had two or three large cardboard boxes besides, but in all
there was no more than could be put on the roof of a four-wheeler. As they
drove through Victoria Street Philip sat well back in the cab in case Norah
should happen to be passing. He had not had an opportunity to telegraph and
could not do so from the post office in the Vauxhall Bridge Road, since she
would wonder what he was doing in that neighbourhood; and if he was there he
could have no excuse for not going into the neighbouring square where she
lived. He made up his mind that he had better go in and see her for half an
hour; but the necessity irritated him: he was angry with Norah, because she
forced him to vulgar and degrading shifts. But he was happy to be with Mildred.
It amused him to help her with the unpacking; and he experienced a charming
sense of possession in installing her in these lodgings which he had found and
was paying for. He would not let her exert herself. It was a pleasure to do
things for her, and she had no desire to do what somebody else seemed desirous
to do for her. He unpacked her clothes and put them away. She was not proposing
to go out again, so he got her slippers and took off her boots. It delighted
him to perform menial offices.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You do spoil me,&rdquo; she said, running her fingers affectionately
through his hair, while he was on his knees unbuttoning her boots.
</p>

<p>
He took her hands and kissed them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is nipping to have you here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He arranged the cushions and the photograph frames. She had several jars of
green earthenware.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you some flowers for them,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
He looked round at his work proudly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As I&rsquo;m not going out any more I think I&rsquo;ll get into a
tea-gown,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Undo me behind, will you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She turned round as unconcernedly as though he were a woman. His sex meant
nothing to her. But his heart was filled with gratitude for the intimacy her
request showed. He undid the hooks and eyes with clumsy fingers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That first day I came into the shop I never thought I&rsquo;d be doing
this for you now,&rdquo; he said, with a laugh which he forced.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Somebody must do it,&rdquo; she answered.
</p>

<p>
She went into the bed-room and slipped into a pale blue tea-gown decorated with
a great deal of cheap lace. Then Philip settled her on a sofa and made tea for
her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t stay and have it with you,&rdquo; he said
regretfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a beastly appointment. But I shall be back
in half an hour.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He wondered what he should say if she asked him what the appointment was, but
she showed no curiosity. He had ordered dinner for the two of them when he took
the rooms, and proposed to spend the evening with her quietly. He was in such a
hurry to get back that he took a tram along the Vauxhall Bridge Road. He
thought he had better break the fact to Norah at once that he could not stay
more than a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, I&rsquo;ve got only just time to say how d&rsquo;you do,&rdquo;
he said, as soon as he got into her rooms. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m frightfully
busy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her face fell.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It exasperated him that she should force him to tell lies, and he knew that he
reddened when he answered that there was a demonstration at the hospital which
he was bound to go to. He fancied that she looked as though she did not believe
him, and this irritated him all the more.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I shall have
you all tomorrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked at her blankly. It was Sunday, and he had been looking forward to
spending the day with Mildred. He told himself that he must do that in common
decency; he could not leave her by herself in a strange house.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, I&rsquo;m engaged tomorrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He knew this was the beginning of a scene which he would have given anything to
avoid. The colour on Norah&rsquo;s cheeks grew brighter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve asked the Gordons to lunch&rdquo;&mdash;they were an
actor and his wife who were touring the provinces and in London for
Sunday&mdash;&ldquo;I told you about it a week ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, I forgot.&rdquo; He hesitated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid I can&rsquo;t possibly come. Isn&rsquo;t there somebody else you can
get?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you doing tomorrow then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t cross-examine me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to tell me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t in the least mind telling you, but it&rsquo;s rather
annoying to be forced to account for all one&rsquo;s movements.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Norah suddenly changed. With an effort of self-control she got the better of
her temper, and going up to him took his hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t disappoint me tomorrow, Philip, I&rsquo;ve been looking
forward so much to spending the day with you. The Gordons want to see you, and
we&rsquo;ll have such a jolly time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to if I could.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very exacting, am I? I don&rsquo;t often ask you to do
anything that&rsquo;s a bother. Won&rsquo;t you get out of your horrid
engagement&mdash;just this once?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, I don&rsquo;t see how I can,&rdquo; he replied
sullenly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell me what it is,&rdquo; she said coaxingly.
</p>

<p>
He had had time to invent something. &ldquo;Griffiths&rsquo; two sisters are up
for the week-end and we&rsquo;re taking them out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; she said joyfully. &ldquo;Griffiths can so easily
get another man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He wished he had thought of something more urgent than that. It was a clumsy
lie.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I&rsquo;ve promised and
I mean to keep my promise.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you promised me too. Surely I come first.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t persist,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
She flared up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t come because you don&rsquo;t want to. I don&rsquo;t know
what you&rsquo;ve been doing the last few days, you&rsquo;ve been quite
different.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked at his watch.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll have to be going,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t come tomorrow?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In that case you needn&rsquo;t trouble to come again,&rdquo; she cried,
losing her temper for good.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just as you like,&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me detain you any longer,&rdquo; she added ironically.
</p>

<p>
He shrugged his shoulders and walked out. He was relieved that it had gone no
worse. There had been no tears. As he walked along he congratulated himself on
getting out of the affair so easily. He went into Victoria Street and bought a
few flowers to take in to Mildred.
</p>

<p>
The little dinner was a great success. Philip had sent in a small pot of
caviare, which he knew she was very fond of, and the landlady brought them up
some cutlets with vegetables and a sweet. Philip had ordered Burgundy, which
was her favourite wine. With the curtains drawn, a bright fire, and one of
Mildred&rsquo;s shades on the lamp, the room was cosy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really just like home,&rdquo; smiled Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I might be worse off, mightn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; she answered.
</p>

<p>
When they finished, Philip drew two arm-chairs in front of the fire, and they
sat down. He smoked his pipe comfortably. He felt happy and generous.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What would you like to do tomorrow?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m going to Tulse Hill. You remember the manageress at the
shop, well, she&rsquo;s married now, and she&rsquo;s asked me to go and spend
the day with her. Of course she thinks I&rsquo;m married too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip&rsquo;s heart sank.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I refused an invitation so that I might spend Sunday with
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He thought that if she loved him she would say that in that case she would stay
with him. He knew very well that Norah would not have hesitated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you were a silly to do that. I&rsquo;ve promised to go for three
weeks and more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But how can you go alone?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I shall say that Emil&rsquo;s away on business. Her husband&rsquo;s
in the glove trade, and he&rsquo;s a very superior fellow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was silent, and bitter feelings passed through his heart. She gave him a
sidelong glance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t grudge me a little pleasure, Philip? You see, it&rsquo;s
the last time I shall be able to go anywhere for I don&rsquo;t know how long,
and I had promised.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He took her hand and smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, darling, I want you to have the best time you can. I only want you
to be happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a little book bound in blue paper lying open, face downwards, on the
sofa, and Philip idly took it up. It was a twopenny novelette, and the author
was Courtenay Paget. That was the name under which Norah wrote.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do like his books,&rdquo; said Mildred. &ldquo;I read them all.
They&rsquo;re so refined.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He remembered what Norah had said of herself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have an immense popularity among kitchen-maids. They think me so
genteel.&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>LXXI</h2>

<p>
Philip, in return for Griffiths&rsquo; confidences, had told him the details of
his own complicated amours, and on Sunday morning, after breakfast when they
sat by the fire in their dressing-gowns and smoked, he recounted the scene of
the previous day. Griffiths congratulated him because he had got out of his
difficulties so easily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the simplest thing in the world to have an affair with a
woman,&rdquo; he remarked sententiously, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a devil of a
nuisance to get out of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip felt a little inclined to pat himself on the back for his skill in
managing the business. At all events he was immensely relieved. He thought of
Mildred enjoying herself in Tulse Hill, and he found in himself a real
satisfaction because she was happy. It was an act of self-sacrifice on his part
that he did not grudge her pleasure even though paid for by his own
disappointment, and it filled his heart with a comfortable glow.
</p>

<p>
But on Monday morning he found on his table a letter from Norah. She wrote:
</p>

<p>
Dearest,
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m sorry I was cross on Saturday. Forgive me and come to tea in the
afternoon as usual. I love you.
</p>

<p>
Your Norah.
</p>

<p>
His heart sank, and he did not know what to do. He took the note to Griffiths
and showed it to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better leave it unanswered,&rdquo; said he.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; cried Philip. &ldquo;I should be miserable if
I thought of her waiting and waiting. You don&rsquo;t know what it is to be
sick for the postman&rsquo;s knock. I do, and I can&rsquo;t expose anybody else
to that torture.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear fellow, one can&rsquo;t break that sort of affair off without
somebody suffering. You must just set your teeth to that. One thing is, it
doesn&rsquo;t last very long.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip felt that Norah had not deserved that he should make her suffer; and
what did Griffiths know about the degrees of anguish she was capable of? He
remembered his own pain when Mildred had told him she was going to be married.
He did not want anyone to experience what he had experienced then.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re so anxious not to give her pain, go back to her,&rdquo;
said Griffiths.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He got up and walked up and down the room nervously. He was angry with Norah
because she had not let the matter rest. She must have seen that he had no more
love to give her. They said women were so quick at seeing those things.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You might help me,&rdquo; he said to Griffiths.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear fellow, don&rsquo;t make such a fuss about it. People do get
over these things, you know. She probably isn&rsquo;t so wrapped up in you as
you think, either. One&rsquo;s always rather apt to exaggerate the passion
one&rsquo;s inspired other people with.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He paused and looked at Philip with amusement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here, there&rsquo;s only one thing you can do. Write to her, and
tell her the thing&rsquo;s over. Put it so that there can be no mistake about
it. It&rsquo;ll hurt her, but it&rsquo;ll hurt her less if you do the thing
brutally than if you try half-hearted ways.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip sat down and wrote the following letter:
</p>

<p>
My dear Norah,
</p>

<p>
I am sorry to make you unhappy, but I think we had better let things remain
where we left them on Saturday. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any use in
letting these things drag on when they&rsquo;ve ceased to be amusing. You told
me to go and I went. I do not propose to come back. Good-bye.<br/>
Philip Carey.
</p>

<p>
He showed the letter to Griffiths and asked him what he thought of it.
Griffiths read it and looked at Philip with twinkling eyes. He did not say what
he felt.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;ll do the trick,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
Philip went out and posted it. He passed an uncomfortable morning, for he
imagined with great detail what Norah would feel when she received his letter.
He tortured himself with the thought of her tears. But at the same time he was
relieved. Imagined grief was more easy to bear than grief seen, and he was free
now to love Mildred with all his soul. His heart leaped at the thought of going
to see her that afternoon, when his day&rsquo;s work at the hospital was over.
</p>

<p>
When as usual he went back to his rooms to tidy himself, he had no sooner put
the latch-key in his door than he heard a voice behind him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;May I come in? I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you for half an hour.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was Norah. He felt himself blush to the roots of his hair. She spoke gaily.
There was no trace of resentment in her voice and nothing to indicate that
there was a rupture between them. He felt himself cornered. He was sick with
fear, but he did his best to smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, do,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
He opened the door, and she preceded him into his sitting-room. He was nervous
and, to give himself countenance, offered her a cigarette and lit one for
himself. She looked at him brightly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why did you write me such a horrid letter, you naughty boy? If I&rsquo;d
taken it seriously it would have made me perfectly wretched.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was meant seriously,&rdquo; he answered gravely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so silly. I lost my temper the other day, and I wrote and
apologised. You weren&rsquo;t satisfied, so I&rsquo;ve come here to apologise
again. After all, you&rsquo;re your own master and I have no claims upon you. I
don&rsquo;t want you to do anything you don&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She got up from the chair in which she was sitting and went towards him
impulsively, with outstretched hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make friends again, Philip. I&rsquo;m so sorry if I offended
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He could not prevent her from taking his hands, but he could not look at her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s too late,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
She let herself down on the floor by his side and clasped his knees.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Philip, don&rsquo;t be silly. I&rsquo;m quick-tempered too and I can
understand that I hurt you, but it&rsquo;s so stupid to sulk over it.
What&rsquo;s the good of making us both unhappy? It&rsquo;s been so jolly, our
friendship.&rdquo; She passed her fingers slowly over his hand. &ldquo;I love
you, Philip.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He got up, disengaging himself from her, and went to the other side of the
room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, I can&rsquo;t do anything. The whole
thing&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you mean to say you don&rsquo;t love me any more?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You were just looking for an opportunity to throw me over and you took
that one?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He did not answer. She looked at him steadily for a time which seemed
intolerable. She was sitting on the floor where he had left her, leaning
against the arm-chair. She began to cry quite silently, without trying to hide
her face, and the large tears rolled down her cheeks one after the other. She
did not sob. It was horribly painful to see her. Philip turned away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry to hurt you. It&rsquo;s not my fault if I
don&rsquo;t love you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She did not answer. She merely sat there, as though she were overwhelmed, and
the tears flowed down her cheeks. It would have been easier to bear if she had
reproached him. He had thought her temper would get the better of her, and he
was prepared for that. At the back of his mind was a feeling that a real
quarrel, in which each said to the other cruel things, would in some way be a
justification of his behaviour. The time passed. At last he grew frightened by
her silent crying; he went into his bed-room and got a glass of water; he
leaned over her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you drink a little? It&rsquo;ll relieve you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She put her lips listlessly to the glass and drank two or three mouthfuls. Then
in an exhausted whisper she asked him for a handkerchief. She dried her eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course I knew you never loved me as much as I loved you,&rdquo; she
moaned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s always the case,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s always one who loves and one who lets himself be
loved.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He thought of Mildred, and a bitter pain traversed his heart. Norah did not
answer for a long time.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d been so miserably unhappy, and my life was so hateful,&rdquo;
she said at last.
</p>

<p>
She did not speak to him, but to herself. He had never heard her before
complain of the life she had led with her husband or of her poverty. He had
always admired the bold front she displayed to the world.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And then you came along and you were so good to me. And I admired you
because you were clever and it was so heavenly to have someone I could put my
trust in. I loved you. I never thought it could come to an end. And without any
fault of mine at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her tears began to flow again, but now she was more mistress of herself, and
she hid her face in Philip&rsquo;s handkerchief. She tried hard to control
herself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give me some more water,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
She wiped her eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to make such a fool of myself. I was so
unprepared.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, Norah. I want you to know that I&rsquo;m very
grateful for all you&rsquo;ve done for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He wondered what it was she saw in him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s always the same,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;if you want
men to behave well to you, you must be beastly to them; if you treat them
decently they make you suffer for it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She got up from the floor and said she must go. She gave Philip a long, steady
look. Then she sighed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so inexplicable. What does it all mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip took a sudden determination.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d better tell you, I don&rsquo;t want you to think too
badly of me, I want you to see that I can&rsquo;t help myself. Mildred&rsquo;s
come back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The colour came to her face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me at once? I deserved that surely.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was afraid to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked at herself in the glass and set her hat straight.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you call me a cab,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel I can
walk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He went to the door and stopped a passing hansom; but when she followed him
into the street he was startled to see how white she was. There was a heaviness
in her movements as though she had suddenly grown older. She looked so ill that
he had not the heart to let her go alone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive back with you if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She did not answer, and he got into the cab. They drove along in silence over
the bridge, through shabby streets in which children, with shrill cries, played
in the road. When they arrived at her door she did not immediately get out. It
seemed as though she could not summon enough strength to her legs to move.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll forgive me, Norah,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
She turned her eyes towards him, and he saw that they were bright again with
tears, but she forced a smile to her lips.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor fellow, you&rsquo;re quite worried about me. You mustn&rsquo;t
bother. I don&rsquo;t blame you. I shall get over it all right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lightly and quickly she stroked his face to show him that she bore no
ill-feeling, the gesture was scarcely more than suggested; then she jumped out
of the cab and let herself into her house.
</p>

<p>
Philip paid the hansom and walked to Mildred&rsquo;s lodgings. There was a
curious heaviness in his heart. He was inclined to reproach himself. But why?
He did not know what else he could have done. Passing a fruiterer&rsquo;s, he
remembered that Mildred was fond of grapes. He was so grateful that he could
show his love for her by recollecting every whim she had.
</p>

<h2>LXXII</h2>

<p>
For the next three months Philip went every day to see Mildred. He took his
books with him and after tea worked, while Mildred lay on the sofa reading
novels. Sometimes he would look up and watch her for a minute. A happy smile
crossed his lips. She would feel his eyes upon her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste your time looking at me, silly. Go on with your
work,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tyrant,&rdquo; he answered gaily.
</p>

<p>
He put aside his book when the landlady came in to lay the cloth for dinner,
and in his high spirits he exchanged chaff with her. She was a little cockney,
of middle age, with an amusing humour and a quick tongue. Mildred had become
great friends with her and had given her an elaborate but mendacious account of
the circumstances which had brought her to the pass she was in. The
good-hearted little woman was touched and found no trouble too great to make
Mildred comfortable. Mildred&rsquo;s sense of propriety had suggested that
Philip should pass himself off as her brother. They dined together, and Philip
was delighted when he had ordered something which tempted Mildred&rsquo;s
capricious appetite. It enchanted him to see her sitting opposite him, and
every now and then from sheer joy he took her hand and pressed it. After dinner
she sat in the arm-chair by the fire, and he settled himself down on the floor
beside her, leaning against her knees, and smoked. Often they did not talk at
all, and sometimes Philip noticed that she had fallen into a doze. He dared not
move then in case he woke her, and he sat very quietly, looking lazily into the
fire and enjoying his happiness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Had a nice little nap?&rdquo; he smiled, when she woke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not been sleeping,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I only just
closed my eyes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She would never acknowledge that she had been asleep. She had a phlegmatic
temperament, and her condition did not seriously inconvenience her. She took a
lot of trouble about her health and accepted the advice of anyone who chose to
offer it. She went for a &lsquo;constitutional&rsquo; every morning that it was
fine and remained out a definite time. When it was not too cold she sat in St.
James&rsquo; Park. But the rest of the day she spent quite happily on her sofa,
reading one novel after another or chatting with the landlady; she had an
inexhaustible interest in gossip, and told Philip with abundant detail the
history of the landlady, of the lodgers on the drawing-room floor, and of the
people who lived in the next house on either side. Now and then she was seized
with panic; she poured out her fears to Philip about the pain of the
confinement and was in terror lest she should die; she gave him a full account
of the confinements of the landlady and of the lady on the drawing-room floor
(Mildred did not know her; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m one to keep myself to
myself,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not one to go about with
anybody.&rdquo;) and she narrated details with a queer mixture of horror and
gusto; but for the most part she looked forward to the occurrence with
equanimity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;After all, I&rsquo;m not the first one to have a baby, am I? And the
doctor says I shan&rsquo;t have any trouble. You see, it isn&rsquo;t as if I
wasn&rsquo;t well made.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Owen, the owner of the house she was going to when her time came, had
recommended a doctor, and Mildred saw him once a week. He was to charge fifteen
guineas.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course I could have got it done cheaper, but Mrs. Owen strongly
recommended him, and I thought it wasn&rsquo;t worth while to spoil the ship
for a coat of tar.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you feel happy and comfortable I don&rsquo;t mind a bit about the
expense,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
She accepted all that Philip did for her as if it were the most natural thing
in the world, and on his side he loved to spend money on her: each five-pound
note he gave her caused him a little thrill of happiness and pride; he gave her
a good many, for she was not economical.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where the money goes to,&rdquo; she said herself,
&ldquo;it seems to slip through my fingers like water.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad to
be able to do anything I can for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She could not sew well and so did not make the necessary things for the baby;
she told Philip it was much cheaper in the end to buy them. Philip had lately
sold one of the mortgages in which his money had been put; and now, with five
hundred pounds in the bank waiting to be invested in something that could be
more easily realised, he felt himself uncommonly well-to-do. They talked often
of the future. Philip was anxious that Mildred should keep the child with her,
but she refused: she had her living to earn, and it would be more easy to do
this if she had not also to look after a baby. Her plan was to get back into
one of the shops of the company for which she had worked before, and the child
could be put with some decent woman in the country.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can find someone who&rsquo;ll look after it well for seven and
sixpence a week. It&rsquo;ll be better for the baby and better for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It seemed callous to Philip, but when he tried to reason with her she pretended
to think he was concerned with the expense.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t worry about that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
shan&rsquo;t ask YOU to pay for it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t care how much I pay.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of her heart was the hope that the child would be still-born. She
did no more than hint it, but Philip saw that the thought was there. He was
shocked at first; and then, reasoning with himself, he was obliged to confess
that for all concerned such an event was to be desired.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very fine to say this and that,&rdquo; Mildred remarked
querulously, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s jolly difficult for a girl to earn her
living by herself; it doesn&rsquo;t make it any easier when she&rsquo;s got a
baby.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fortunately you&rsquo;ve got me to fall back on,&rdquo; smiled Philip,
taking her hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been good to me, Philip.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, what rot!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t offer anything in return for what
you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good heavens, I don&rsquo;t want a return. If I&rsquo;ve done anything
for you, I&rsquo;ve done it because I love you. You owe me nothing. I
don&rsquo;t want you to do anything unless you love me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was a little horrified by her feeling that her body was a commodity which
she could deliver indifferently as an acknowledgment for services rendered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I do want to, Philip. You&rsquo;ve been so good to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, it won&rsquo;t hurt for waiting. When you&rsquo;re all right again
we&rsquo;ll go for our little honeymoon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are naughty,&rdquo; she said, smiling.
</p>

<p>
Mildred expected to be confined early in March, and as soon as she was well
enough she was to go to the seaside for a fortnight: that would give Philip a
chance to work without interruption for his examination; after that came the
Easter holidays, and they had arranged to go to Paris together. Philip talked
endlessly of the things they would do. Paris was delightful then. They would
take a room in a little hotel he knew in the Latin Quarter, and they would eat
in all sorts of charming little restaurants; they would go to the play, and he
would take her to music halls. It would amuse her to meet his friends. He had
talked to her about Cronshaw, she would see him; and there was Lawson, he had
gone to Paris for a couple of months; and they would go to the Bal Bullier;
there were excursions; they would make trips to Versailles, Chartres,
Fontainebleau.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll cost a lot of money,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, damn the expense. Think how I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to it.
Don&rsquo;t you know what it means to me? I&rsquo;ve never loved anyone but
you. I never shall.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She listened to his enthusiasm with smiling eyes. He thought he saw in them a
new tenderness, and he was grateful to her. She was much gentler than she used
to be. There was in her no longer the superciliousness which had irritated him.
She was so accustomed to him now that she took no pains to keep up before him
any pretences. She no longer troubled to do her hair with the old elaboration,
but just tied it in a knot; and she left off the vast fringe which she
generally wore: the more careless style suited her. Her face was so thin that
it made her eyes seem very large; there were heavy lines under them, and the
pallor of her cheeks made their colour more profound. She had a wistful look
which was infinitely pathetic. There seemed to Philip to be in her something of
the Madonna. He wished they could continue in that same way always. He was
happier than he had ever been in his life.
</p>

<p>
He used to leave her at ten o&rsquo;clock every night, for she liked to go to
bed early, and he was obliged to put in another couple of hours&rsquo; work to
make up for the lost evening. He generally brushed her hair for her before he
went. He had made a ritual of the kisses he gave her when he bade her
good-night; first he kissed the palms of her hands (how thin the fingers were,
the nails were beautiful, for she spent much time in manicuring them,) then he
kissed her closed eyes, first the right one and then the left, and at last he
kissed her lips. He went home with a heart overflowing with love. He longed for
an opportunity to gratify the desire for self-sacrifice which consumed him.
</p>

<p>
Presently the time came for her to move to the nursing-home where she was to be
confined. Philip was then able to visit her only in the afternoons. Mildred
changed her story and represented herself as the wife of a soldier who had gone
to India to join his regiment, and Philip was introduced to the mistress of the
establishment as her brother-in-law.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have to be rather careful what I say,&rdquo; she told him, &ldquo;as
there&rsquo;s another lady here whose husband&rsquo;s in the Indian
Civil.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t let that disturb me if I were you,&rdquo; said Philip.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m convinced that her husband and yours went out on the same
boat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What boat?&rdquo; she asked innocently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Flying Dutchman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mildred was safely delivered of a daughter, and when Philip was allowed to see
her the child was lying by her side. Mildred was very weak, but relieved that
everything was over. She showed him the baby, and herself looked at it
curiously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a funny-looking little thing, isn&rsquo;t it? I can&rsquo;t
believe it&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was red and wrinkled and odd. Philip smiled when he looked at it. He did not
quite know what to say; and it embarrassed him because the nurse who owned the
house was standing by his side; and he felt by the way she was looking at him
that, disbelieving Mildred&rsquo;s complicated story, she thought he was the
father.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you going to call her?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make up my mind if I shall call her Madeleine or
Cecilia.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The nurse left them alone for a few minutes, and Philip bent down and kissed
Mildred on the mouth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad it&rsquo;s all over happily, darling.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She put her thin arms round his neck.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have been a brick to me, Phil dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now I feel that you&rsquo;re mine at last. I&rsquo;ve waited so long for
you, my dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They heard the nurse at the door, and Philip hurriedly got up. The nurse
entered. There was a slight smile on her lips.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>LXXIII</h2>

<p>
Three weeks later Philip saw Mildred and her baby off to Brighton. She had made
a quick recovery and looked better than he had ever seen her. She was going to
a boarding-house where she had spent a couple of weekends with Emil Miller, and
had written to say that her husband was obliged to go to Germany on business
and she was coming down with her baby. She got pleasure out of the stories she
invented, and she showed a certain fertility of invention in the working out of
the details. Mildred proposed to find in Brighton some woman who would be
willing to take charge of the baby. Philip was startled at the callousness with
which she insisted on getting rid of it so soon, but she argued with common
sense that the poor child had much better be put somewhere before it grew used
to her. Philip had expected the maternal instinct to make itself felt when she
had had the baby two or three weeks and had counted on this to help him
persuade her to keep it; but nothing of the sort occurred. Mildred was not
unkind to her baby; she did all that was necessary; it amused her sometimes,
and she talked about it a good deal; but at heart she was indifferent to it.
She could not look upon it as part of herself. She fancied it resembled its
father already. She was continually wondering how she would manage when it grew
older; and she was exasperated with herself for being such a fool as to have it
at all.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d only known then all I do now,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
She laughed at Philip, because he was anxious about its welfare.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t make more fuss if you was the father,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see Emil getting into such a stew about
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip&rsquo;s mind was full of the stories he had heard of baby-farming and
the ghouls who ill-treat the wretched children that selfish, cruel parents have
put in their charge.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so silly,&rdquo; said Mildred. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s when
you give a woman a sum down to look after a baby. But when you&rsquo;re going
to pay so much a week it&rsquo;s to their interest to look after it
well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip insisted that Mildred should place the child with people who had no
children of their own and would promise to take no other.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t haggle about the price,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
rather pay half a guinea a week than run any risk of the kid being starved or
beaten.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a funny old thing, Philip,&rdquo; she laughed.
</p>

<p>
To him there was something very touching in the child&rsquo;s helplessness. It
was small, ugly, and querulous. Its birth had been looked forward to with shame
and anguish. Nobody wanted it. It was dependent on him, a stranger, for food,
shelter, and clothes to cover its nakedness.
</p>

<p>
As the train started he kissed Mildred. He would have kissed the baby too, but
he was afraid she would laugh at him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will write to me, darling, won&rsquo;t you? And I shall look forward
to your coming back with oh! such impatience.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mind you get through your exam.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had been working for it industriously, and now with only ten days before him
he made a final effort. He was very anxious to pass, first to save himself time
and expense, for money had been slipping through his fingers during the last
four months with incredible speed; and then because this examination marked the
end of the drudgery: after that the student had to do with medicine, midwifery,
and surgery, the interest of which was more vivid than the anatomy and
physiology with which he had been hitherto concerned. Philip looked forward
with interest to the rest of the curriculum. Nor did he want to have to confess
to Mildred that he had failed: though the examination was difficult and the
majority of candidates were ploughed at the first attempt, he knew that she
would think less well of him if he did not succeed; she had a peculiarly
humiliating way of showing what she thought.
</p>

<p>
Mildred sent him a postcard to announce her safe arrival, and he snatched half
an hour every day to write a long letter to her. He had always a certain
shyness in expressing himself by word of mouth, but he found he could tell her,
pen in hand, all sorts of things which it would have made him feel ridiculous
to say. Profiting by the discovery he poured out to her his whole heart. He had
never been able to tell her before how his adoration filled every part of him
so that all his actions, all his thoughts, were touched with it. He wrote to
her of the future, the happiness that lay before him, and the gratitude which
he owed her. He asked himself (he had often asked himself before but had never
put it into words) what it was in her that filled him with such extravagant
delight; he did not know; he knew only that when she was with him he was happy,
and when she was away from him the world was on a sudden cold and gray; he knew
only that when he thought of her his heart seemed to grow big in his body so
that it was difficult to breathe (as if it pressed against his lungs) and it
throbbed, so that the delight of her presence was almost pain; his knees shook,
and he felt strangely weak as though, not having eaten, he were tremulous from
want of food. He looked forward eagerly to her answers. He did not expect her
to write often, for he knew that letter-writing came difficultly to her; and he
was quite content with the clumsy little note that arrived in reply to four of
his. She spoke of the boarding-house in which she had taken a room, of the
weather and the baby, told him she had been for a walk on the front with a
lady-friend whom she had met in the boarding-house and who had taken such a
fancy to baby, she was going to the theatre on Saturday night, and Brighton was
filling up. It touched Philip because it was so matter-of-fact. The crabbed
style, the formality of the matter, gave him a queer desire to laugh and to
take her in his arms and kiss her.
</p>

<p>
He went into the examination with happy confidence. There was nothing in either
of the papers that gave him trouble. He knew that he had done well, and though
the second part of the examination was viva voce and he was more nervous, he
managed to answer the questions adequately. He sent a triumphant telegram to
Mildred when the result was announced.
</p>

<p>
When he got back to his rooms Philip found a letter from her, saying that she
thought it would be better for her to stay another week in Brighton. She had
found a woman who would be glad to take the baby for seven shillings a week,
but she wanted to make inquiries about her, and she was herself benefiting so
much by the sea-air that she was sure a few days more would do her no end of
good. She hated asking Philip for money, but would he send some by return, as
she had had to buy herself a new hat, she couldn&rsquo;t go about with her
lady-friend always in the same hat, and her lady-friend was so dressy. Philip
had a moment of bitter disappointment. It took away all his pleasure at getting
through his examination.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If she loved me one quarter as much as I love her she couldn&rsquo;t
bear to stay away a day longer than necessary.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He put the thought away from him quickly; it was pure selfishness; of course
her health was more important than anything else. But he had nothing to do now;
he might spend the week with her in Brighton, and they could be together all
day. His heart leaped at the thought. It would be amusing to appear before
Mildred suddenly with the information that he had taken a room in the
boarding-house. He looked out trains. But he paused. He was not certain that
she would be pleased to see him; she had made friends in Brighton; he was
quiet, and she liked boisterous joviality; he realised that she amused herself
more with other people than with him. It would torture him if he felt for an
instant that he was in the way. He was afraid to risk it. He dared not even
write and suggest that, with nothing to keep him in town, he would like to
spend the week where he could see her every day. She knew he had nothing to do;
if she wanted him to come she would have asked him to. He dared not risk the
anguish he would suffer if he proposed to come and she made excuses to prevent
him.
</p>

<p>
He wrote to her next day, sent her a five-pound note, and at the end of his
letter said that if she were very nice and cared to see him for the week-end he
would be glad to run down; but she was by no means to alter any plans she had
made. He awaited her answer with impatience. In it she said that if she had
only known before she could have arranged it, but she had promised to go to a
music-hall on the Saturday night; besides, it would make the people at the
boarding-house talk if he stayed there. Why did he not come on Sunday morning
and spend the day? They could lunch at the Metropole, and she would take him
afterwards to see the very superior lady-like person who was going to take the
baby.
</p>

<p>
Sunday. He blessed the day because it was fine. As the train approached
Brighton the sun poured through the carriage window. Mildred was waiting for
him on the platform.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How jolly of you to come and meet me!&rdquo; he cried, as he seized her
hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You expected me, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hoped you would. I say, how well you&rsquo;re looking.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s done me a rare lot of good, but I think I&rsquo;m wise to
stay here as long as I can. And there are a very nice class of people at the
boarding-house. I wanted cheering up after seeing nobody all these months. It
was dull sometimes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked very smart in her new hat, a large black straw with a great many
inexpensive flowers on it; and round her neck floated a long boa of imitation
swansdown. She was still very thin, and she stooped a little when she walked
(she had always done that,) but her eyes did not seem so large; and though she
never had any colour, her skin had lost the earthy look it had. They walked
down to the sea. Philip, remembering he had not walked with her for months,
grew suddenly conscious of his limp and walked stiffly in the attempt to
conceal it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you glad to see me?&rdquo; he asked, love dancing madly in his
heart.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course I am. You needn&rsquo;t ask that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By the way, Griffiths sends you his love.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What cheek!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had talked to her a great deal of Griffiths. He had told her how flirtatious
he was and had amused her often with the narration of some adventure which
Griffiths under the seal of secrecy had imparted to him. Mildred had listened,
with some pretence of disgust sometimes, but generally with curiosity; and
Philip, admiringly, had enlarged upon his friend&rsquo;s good looks and charm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll like him just as much as I do. He&rsquo;s so
jolly and amusing, and he&rsquo;s such an awfully good sort.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip told her how, when they were perfect strangers, Griffiths had nursed him
through an illness; and in the telling Griffiths&rsquo; self-sacrifice lost
nothing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t help liking him,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like good-looking men,&rdquo; said Mildred.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re too conceited for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He wants to know you. I&rsquo;ve talked to him about you an awful
lot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What have you said?&rdquo; asked Mildred.
</p>

<p>
Philip had no one but Griffiths to talk to of his love for Mildred, and little
by little had told him the whole story of his connection with her. He described
her to him fifty times. He dwelt amorously on every detail of her appearance,
and Griffiths knew exactly how her thin hands were shaped and how white her
face was, and he laughed at Philip when he talked of the charm of her pale,
thin lips.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove, I&rsquo;m glad I don&rsquo;t take things so badly as
that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Life wouldn&rsquo;t be worth living.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip smiled. Griffiths did not know the delight of being so madly in love
that it was like meat and wine and the air one breathed and whatever else was
essential to existence. Griffiths knew that Philip had looked after the girl
while she was having her baby and was now going away with her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I must say you&rsquo;ve deserved to get something,&rdquo; he
remarked. &ldquo;It must have cost you a pretty penny. It&rsquo;s lucky you can
afford it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;But what do I care!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Since it was early for luncheon, Philip and Mildred sat in one of the shelters
on the parade, sunning themselves, and watched the people pass. There were the
Brighton shop-boys who walked in twos and threes, swinging their canes, and
there were the Brighton shop-girls who tripped along in giggling bunches. They
could tell the people who had come down from London for the day; the keen air
gave a fillip to their weariness. There were many Jews, stout ladies in tight
satin dresses and diamonds, little corpulent men with a gesticulative manner.
There were middle-aged gentlemen spending a week-end in one of the large
hotels, carefully dressed; and they walked industriously after too substantial
a breakfast to give themselves an appetite for too substantial a luncheon: they
exchanged the time of day with friends and talked of Dr. Brighton or
London-by-the-Sea. Here and there a well-known actor passed, elaborately
unconscious of the attention he excited: sometimes he wore patent leather
boots, a coat with an astrakhan collar, and carried a silver-knobbed stick; and
sometimes, looking as though he had come from a day&rsquo;s shooting, he
strolled in knickerbockers, and ulster of Harris tweed, and a tweed hat on the
back of his head. The sun shone on the blue sea, and the blue sea was trim and
neat.
</p>

<p>
After luncheon they went to Hove to see the woman who was to take charge of the
baby. She lived in a small house in a back street, but it was clean and tidy.
Her name was Mrs. Harding. She was an elderly, stout person, with gray hair and
a red, fleshy face. She looked motherly in her cap, and Philip thought she
seemed kind.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you find it an awful nuisance to look after a baby?&rdquo;
he asked her.
</p>

<p>
She explained that her husband was a curate, a good deal older than herself,
who had difficulty in getting permanent work since vicars wanted young men to
assist them; he earned a little now and then by doing locums when someone took
a holiday or fell ill, and a charitable institution gave them a small pension;
but her life was lonely, it would be something to do to look after a child, and
the few shillings a week paid for it would help her to keep things going. She
promised that it should be well fed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite the lady, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; said Mildred, when they went
away.
</p>

<p>
They went back to have tea at the Metropole. Mildred liked the crowd and the
band. Philip was tired of talking, and he watched her face as she looked with
keen eyes at the dresses of the women who came in. She had a peculiar sharpness
for reckoning up what things cost, and now and then she leaned over to him and
whispered the result of her meditations.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you see that aigrette there? That cost every bit of seven
guineas.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Or: &ldquo;Look at that ermine, Philip. That&rsquo;s rabbit, that
is&mdash;that&rsquo;s not ermine.&rdquo; She laughed triumphantly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d know it a mile off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip smiled happily. He was glad to see her pleasure, and the ingenuousness
of her conversation amused and touched him. The band played sentimental music.
</p>

<p>
After dinner they walked down to the station, and Philip took her arm. He told
her what arrangements he had made for their journey to France. She was to come
up to London at the end of the week, but she told him that she could not go
away till the Saturday of the week after that. He had already engaged a room in
a hotel in Paris. He was looking forward eagerly to taking the tickets.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t mind going second-class, will you? We mustn&rsquo;t be
extravagant, and it&rsquo;ll be all the better if we can do ourselves pretty
well when we get there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had talked to her a hundred times of the Quarter. They would wander through
its pleasant old streets, and they would sit idly in the charming gardens of
the Luxembourg. If the weather was fine perhaps, when they had had enough of
Paris, they might go to Fontainebleau. The trees would be just bursting into
leaf. The green of the forest in spring was more beautiful than anything he
knew; it was like a song, and it was like the happy pain of love. Mildred
listened quietly. He turned to her and tried to look deep into her eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You do want to come, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; she smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m looking forward to it. I don&rsquo;t
know how I shall get through the next days. I&rsquo;m so afraid something will
happen to prevent it. It maddens me sometimes that I can&rsquo;t tell you how
much I love you. And at last, at last…&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He broke off. They reached the station, but they had dawdled on the way, and
Philip had barely time to say good-night. He kissed her quickly and ran towards
the wicket as fast as he could. She stood where he left her. He was strangely
grotesque when he ran.
</p>

<h2>LXXIV</h2>

<p>
The following Saturday Mildred returned, and that evening Philip kept her to
himself. He took seats for the play, and they drank champagne at dinner. It was
her first gaiety in London for so long that she enjoyed everything ingenuously.
She cuddled up to Philip when they drove from the theatre to the room he had
taken for her in Pimlico.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I really believe you&rsquo;re quite glad to see me,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
She did not answer, but gently pressed his hand. Demonstrations of affection
were so rare with her that Philip was enchanted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve asked Griffiths to dine with us tomorrow,&rdquo; he told her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve done that. I wanted to meet him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was no place of entertainment to take her to on Sunday night, and Philip
was afraid she would be bored if she were alone with him all day. Griffiths was
amusing; he would help them to get through the evening; and Philip was so fond
of them both that he wanted them to know and to like one another. He left
Mildred with the words:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only six days more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They had arranged to dine in the gallery at Romano&rsquo;s on Sunday, because
the dinner was excellent and looked as though it cost a good deal more than it
did. Philip and Mildred arrived first and had to wait some time for Griffiths.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an unpunctual devil,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
probably making love to one of his numerous flames.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But presently he appeared. He was a handsome creature, tall and thin; his head
was placed well on the body, it gave him a conquering air which was attractive;
and his curly hair, his bold, friendly blue eyes, his red mouth, were charming.
Philip saw Mildred look at him with appreciation, and he felt a curious
satisfaction. Griffiths greeted them with a smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard a great deal about you,&rdquo; he said to Mildred, as
he took her hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not so much as I&rsquo;ve heard about you,&rdquo; she answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nor so bad,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has he been blackening my character?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Griffiths laughed, and Philip saw that Mildred noticed how white and regular
his teeth were and how pleasant his smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You ought to feel like old friends,&rdquo; said Philip.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve talked so much about you to one another.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Griffiths was in the best possible humour, for, having at length passed his
final examination, he was qualified, and he had just been appointed
house-surgeon at a hospital in the North of London. He was taking up his duties
at the beginning of May and meanwhile was going home for a holiday; this was
his last week in town, and he was determined to get as much enjoyment into it
as he could. He began to talk the gay nonsense which Philip admired because he
could not copy it. There was nothing much in what he said, but his vivacity
gave it point. There flowed from him a force of life which affected everyone
who knew him; it was almost as sensible as bodily warmth. Mildred was more
lively than Philip had ever known her, and he was delighted to see that his
little party was a success. She was amusing herself enormously. She laughed
louder and louder. She quite forgot the genteel reserve which had become second
nature to her.
</p>

<p>
Presently Griffiths said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, it&rsquo;s dreadfully difficult for me to call you Mrs. Miller.
Philip never calls you anything but Mildred.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I daresay she won&rsquo;t scratch your eyes out if you call her that
too,&rdquo; laughed Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then she must call me Harry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip sat silent while they chattered away and thought how good it was to see
people happy. Now and then Griffiths teased him a little, kindly, because he
was always so serious.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I believe he&rsquo;s quite fond of you, Philip,&rdquo; smiled Mildred.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t a bad old thing,&rdquo; answered Griffiths, and taking
Philip&rsquo;s hand he shook it gaily.
</p>

<p>
It seemed an added charm in Griffiths that he liked Philip. They were all sober
people, and the wine they had drunk went to their heads. Griffiths became more
talkative and so boisterous that Philip, amused, had to beg him to be quiet. He
had a gift for story-telling, and his adventures lost nothing of their romance
and their laughter in his narration. He played in all of them a gallant,
humorous part. Mildred, her eyes shining with excitement, urged him on. He
poured out anecdote after anecdote. When the lights began to be turned out she
was astonished.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My word, the evening has gone quickly. I thought it wasn&rsquo;t more
than half past nine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They got up to go and when she said good-bye, she added:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to have tea at Philip&rsquo;s room tomorrow. You might
look in if you can.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he smiled.
</p>

<p>
On the way back to Pimlico Mildred talked of nothing but Griffiths. She was
taken with his good looks, his well-cut clothes, his voice, his gaiety.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am glad you like him,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;D&rsquo;you remember
you were rather sniffy about meeting him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s so nice of him to be so fond of you, Philip. He is a
nice friend for you to have.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She put up her face to Philip for him to kiss her. It was a thing she did
rarely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have enjoyed myself this evening, Philip. Thank you so much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so absurd,&rdquo; he laughed, touched by her appreciation
so that he felt the moisture come to his eyes.
</p>

<p>
She opened her door and just before she went in, turned again to Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell Harry I&rsquo;m madly in love with him,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Next day, when they were having tea, Griffiths came in. He sank lazily into an
arm-chair. There was something strangely sensual in the slow movements of his
large limbs. Philip remained silent, while the others chattered away, but he
was enjoying himself. He admired them both so much that it seemed natural
enough for them to admire one another. He did not care if Griffiths absorbed
Mildred&rsquo;s attention, he would have her to himself during the evening: he
had something of the attitude of a loving husband, confident in his
wife&rsquo;s affection, who looks on with amusement while she flirts harmlessly
with a stranger. But at half past seven he looked at his watch and said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time we went out to dinner, Mildred.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a moment&rsquo;s pause, and Griffiths seemed to be considering.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be getting along,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know it was so late.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you doing anything tonight?&rdquo; asked Mildred.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was another silence. Philip felt slightly irritated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just go and have a wash,&rdquo; he said, and to Mildred he
added: &ldquo;Would you like to wash your hands?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She did not answer him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come and dine with us?&rdquo; she said to Griffiths.
</p>

<p>
He looked at Philip and saw him staring at him sombrely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I dined with you last night,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;I should be in
the way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; insisted Mildred. &ldquo;Make him
come, Philip. He won&rsquo;t be in the way, will he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let him come by all means if he&rsquo;d like to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, then,&rdquo; said Griffiths promptly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just
go upstairs and tidy myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The moment he left the room Philip turned to Mildred angrily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why on earth did you ask him to dine with us?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help myself. It would have looked so funny to say
nothing when he said he wasn&rsquo;t doing anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, what rot! And why the hell did you ask him if he was doing
anything?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mildred&rsquo;s pale lips tightened a little.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want a little amusement sometimes. I get tired always being alone with
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They heard Griffiths coming heavily down the stairs, and Philip went into his
bed-room to wash. They dined in the neighbourhood in an Italian restaurant.
Philip was cross and silent, but he quickly realised that he was showing to
disadvantage in comparison with Griffiths, and he forced himself to hide his
annoyance. He drank a good deal of wine to destroy the pain that was gnawing at
his heart, and he set himself to talk. Mildred, as though remorseful for what
she had said, did all she could to make herself pleasant to him. She was kindly
and affectionate. Presently Philip began to think he had been a fool to
surrender to a feeling of jealousy. After dinner when they got into a hansom to
drive to a music-hall Mildred, sitting between the two men, of her own accord
gave him her hand. His anger vanished. Suddenly, he knew not how, he grew
conscious that Griffiths was holding her other hand. The pain seized him again
violently, it was a real physical pain, and he asked himself, panic-stricken,
what he might have asked himself before, whether Mildred and Griffiths were in
love with one another. He could not see anything of the performance on account
of the mist of suspicion, anger, dismay, and wretchedness which seemed to be
before his eyes; but he forced himself to conceal the fact that anything was
the matter; he went on talking and laughing. Then a strange desire to torture
himself seized him, and he got up, saying he wanted to go and drink something.
Mildred and Griffiths had never been alone together for a moment. He wanted to
leave them by themselves.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come too,&rdquo; said Griffiths. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got rather
a thirst on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, nonsense, you stay and talk to Mildred.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip did not know why he said that. He was throwing them together now to make
the pain he suffered more intolerable. He did not go to the bar, but up into
the balcony, from where he could watch them and not be seen. They had ceased to
look at the stage and were smiling into one another&rsquo;s eyes. Griffiths was
talking with his usual happy fluency and Mildred seemed to hang on his lips.
Philip&rsquo;s head began to ache frightfully. He stood there motionless. He
knew he would be in the way if he went back. They were enjoying themselves
without him, and he was suffering, suffering. Time passed, and now he had an
extraordinary shyness about rejoining them. He knew they had not thought of him
at all, and he reflected bitterly that he had paid for the dinner and their
seats in the music-hall. What a fool they were making of him! He was hot with
shame. He could see how happy they were without him. His instinct was to leave
them to themselves and go home, but he had not his hat and coat, and it would
necessitate endless explanations. He went back. He felt a shadow of annoyance
in Mildred&rsquo;s eyes when she saw him, and his heart sank.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been a devil of a time,&rdquo; said Griffiths, with a smile
of welcome.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I met some men I knew. I&rsquo;ve been talking to them, and I
couldn&rsquo;t get away. I thought you&rsquo;d be all right together.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been enjoying myself thoroughly,&rdquo; said Griffiths.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about Mildred.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She gave a little laugh of happy complacency. There was a vulgar sound in the
ring of it that horrified Philip. He suggested that they should go.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Griffiths, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll both drive you
home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip suspected that she had suggested that arrangement so that she might not
be left alone with him. In the cab he did not take her hand nor did she offer
it, and he knew all the time that she was holding Griffiths&rsquo;. His chief
thought was that it was all so horribly vulgar. As they drove along he asked
himself what plans they had made to meet without his knowledge, he cursed
himself for having left them alone, he had actually gone out of his way to
enable them to arrange things.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep the cab,&rdquo; said Philip, when they reached the
house in which Mildred was lodging. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too tired to walk
home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
On the way back Griffiths talked gaily and seemed indifferent to the fact that
Philip answered in monosyllables. Philip felt he must notice that something was
the matter. Philip&rsquo;s silence at last grew too significant to struggle
against, and Griffiths, suddenly nervous, ceased talking. Philip wanted to say
something, but he was so shy he could hardly bring himself to, and yet the time
was passing and the opportunity would be lost. It was best to get at the truth
at once. He forced himself to speak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you in love with Mildred?&rdquo; he asked suddenly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I?&rdquo; Griffiths laughed. &ldquo;Is that what you&rsquo;ve been so
funny about this evening? Of course not, my dear old man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He tried to slip his hand through Philip&rsquo;s arm, but Philip drew himself
away. He knew Griffiths was lying. He could not bring himself to force
Griffiths to tell him that he had not been holding the girl&rsquo;s hand. He
suddenly felt very weak and broken.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter to you, Harry,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got so many women&mdash;don&rsquo;t take her away from me.
It means my whole life. I&rsquo;ve been so awfully wretched.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His voice broke, and he could not prevent the sob that was torn from him. He
was horribly ashamed of himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear old boy, you know I wouldn&rsquo;t do anything to hurt you.
I&rsquo;m far too fond of you for that. I was only playing the fool. If
I&rsquo;d known you were going to take it like that I&rsquo;d have been more
careful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a twopenny damn for her. I give you my word of
honour.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip gave a sigh of relief. The cab stopped at their door.
</p>

<p>
Next day Philip was in a good temper. He was very anxious not to bore Mildred
with too much of his society, and so had arranged that he should not see her
till dinner-time. She was ready when he fetched her, and he chaffed her for her
unwonted punctuality. She was wearing a new dress he had given her. He remarked
on its smartness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll have to go back and be altered,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The
skirt hangs all wrong.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to make the dressmaker hurry up if you want to take it
to Paris with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be ready in time for that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only three more whole days. We&rsquo;ll go over by the eleven
o&rsquo;clock, shall we?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He would have her for nearly a month entirely to himself. His eyes rested on
her with hungry adoration. He was able to laugh a little at his own passion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder what it is I see in you,&rdquo; he smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nice thing to say,&rdquo; she answered.
</p>

<p>
Her body was so thin that one could almost see her skeleton. Her chest was as
flat as a boy&rsquo;s. Her mouth, with its narrow pale lips, was ugly, and her
skin was faintly green.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall give you Blaud&rsquo;s Pills in quantities when we&rsquo;re
away,&rdquo; said Philip, laughing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to bring you back
fat and rosy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get fat,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
She did not speak of Griffiths, and presently while they were dining Philip
half in malice, for he felt sure of himself and his power over her, said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It seems to me you were having a great flirtation with Harry last
night?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I told you I was in love with him,&rdquo; she laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to know that he&rsquo;s not in love with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How d&rsquo;you know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I asked him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She hesitated a moment, looking at Philip, and a curious gleam came into her
eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would you like to read a letter I had from him this morning?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She handed him an envelope and Philip recognised Griffiths&rsquo; bold, legible
writing. There were eight pages. It was well written, frank and charming; it
was the letter of a man who was used to making love to women. He told Mildred
that he loved her passionately, he had fallen in love with her the first moment
he saw her; he did not want to love her, for he knew how fond Philip was of
her, but he could not help himself. Philip was such a dear, and he was very
much ashamed of himself, but it was not his fault, he was just carried away. He
paid her delightful compliments. Finally he thanked her for consenting to lunch
with him next day and said he was dreadfully impatient to see her. Philip
noticed that the letter was dated the night before; Griffiths must have written
it after leaving Philip, and had taken the trouble to go out and post it when
Philip thought he was in bed.
</p>

<p>
He read it with a sickening palpitation of his heart, but gave no outward sign
of surprise. He handed it back to Mildred with a smile, calmly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you enjoy your lunch?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rather,&rdquo; she said emphatically.
</p>

<p>
He felt that his hands were trembling, so he put them under the table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t take Griffiths too seriously. He&rsquo;s just a
butterfly, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She took the letter and looked at it again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it either,&rdquo; she said, in a voice which she
tried to make nonchalant. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s come over
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little awkward for me, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
She gave him a quick look.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re taking it pretty calmly, I must say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you expect me to do? Do you want me to tear out my hair in
handfuls?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d be angry with me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The funny thing is, I&rsquo;m not at all. I ought to have known this
would happen. I was a fool to bring you together. I know perfectly well that
he&rsquo;s got every advantage over me; he&rsquo;s much jollier, and he&rsquo;s
very handsome, he&rsquo;s more amusing, he can talk to you about the things
that interest you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by that. If I&rsquo;m not clever I
can&rsquo;t help it, but I&rsquo;m not the fool you think I am, not by a long
way, I can tell you. You&rsquo;re a bit too superior for me, my young
friend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you want to quarrel with me?&rdquo; he asked mildly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, but I don&rsquo;t see why you should treat me as if I was I
don&rsquo;t know what.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean to offend you. I just wanted to
talk things over quietly. We don&rsquo;t want to make a mess of them if we can
help it. I saw you were attracted by him and it seemed to me very natural. The
only thing that really hurts me is that he should have encouraged you. He knew
how awfully keen I was on you. I think it&rsquo;s rather shabby of him to have
written that letter to you five minutes after he told me he didn&rsquo;t care
twopence about you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you think you&rsquo;re going to make me like him any the less by
saying nasty things about him, you&rsquo;re mistaken.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was silent for a moment. He did not know what words he could use to make
her see his point of view. He wanted to speak coolly and deliberately, but he
was in such a turmoil of emotion that he could not clear his thoughts.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not worth while sacrificing everything for an infatuation
that you know can&rsquo;t last. After all, he doesn&rsquo;t care for anyone
more than ten days, and you&rsquo;re rather cold; that sort of thing
doesn&rsquo;t mean very much to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you think.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She made it more difficult for him by adopting a cantankerous tone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re in love with him you can&rsquo;t help it. I&rsquo;ll
just bear it as best I can. We get on very well together, you and I, and
I&rsquo;ve not behaved badly to you, have I? I&rsquo;ve always known that
you&rsquo;re not in love with me, but you like me all right, and when we get
over to Paris you&rsquo;ll forget about Griffiths. If you make up your mind to
put him out of your thoughts you won&rsquo;t find it so hard as all that, and
I&rsquo;ve deserved that you should do something for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She did not answer, and they went on eating their dinner. When the silence grew
oppressive Philip began to talk of indifferent things. He pretended not to
notice that Mildred was inattentive. Her answers were perfunctory, and she
volunteered no remarks of her own. At last she interrupted abruptly what he was
saying:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Philip, I&rsquo;m afraid I shan&rsquo;t be able to go away on Saturday.
The doctor says I oughtn&rsquo;t to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He knew this was not true, but he answered:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When will you be able to come away?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She glanced at him, saw that his face was white and rigid, and looked nervously
away. She was at that moment a little afraid of him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I may as well tell you and have done with it, I can&rsquo;t come away
with you at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought you were driving at that. It&rsquo;s too late to change your
mind now. I&rsquo;ve got the tickets and everything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You said you didn&rsquo;t wish me to go unless I wanted it too, and I
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve changed my mind. I&rsquo;m not going to have any more tricks
played with me. You must come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I like you very much, Philip, as a friend. But I can&rsquo;t bear to
think of anything else. I don&rsquo;t like you that way. I couldn&rsquo;t,
Philip.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You were quite willing to a week ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was different then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You hadn&rsquo;t met Griffiths?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You said yourself I couldn&rsquo;t help it if I&rsquo;m in love with
him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her face was set into a sulky look, and she kept her eyes fixed on her plate.
Philip was white with rage. He would have liked to hit her in the face with his
clenched fist, and in fancy he saw how she would look with a black eye. There
were two lads of eighteen dining at a table near them, and now and then they
looked at Mildred; he wondered if they envied him dining with a pretty girl;
perhaps they were wishing they stood in his shoes. It was Mildred who broke the
silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of our going away together? I&rsquo;d be thinking
of him all the time. It wouldn&rsquo;t be much fun for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my business,&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
She thought over all his reply implicated, and she reddened.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s just beastly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What of it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought you were a gentleman in every sense of the word.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You were mistaken.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His reply entertained him, and he laughed as he said it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t laugh,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t come away with you, Philip. I&rsquo;m awfully sorry. I know I
haven&rsquo;t behaved well to you, but one can&rsquo;t force themselves.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you forgotten that when you were in trouble I did everything for
you? I planked out the money to keep you till your baby was born, I paid for
your doctor and everything, I paid for you to go to Brighton, and I&rsquo;m
paying for the keep of your baby, I&rsquo;m paying for your clothes, I&rsquo;m
paying for every stitch you&rsquo;ve got on now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you was a gentleman you wouldn&rsquo;t throw what you&rsquo;ve done
for me in my face.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, for goodness&rsquo; sake, shut up. What d&rsquo;you suppose I care
if I&rsquo;m a gentleman or not? If I were a gentleman I shouldn&rsquo;t waste
my time with a vulgar slut like you. I don&rsquo;t care a damn if you like me
or not. I&rsquo;m sick of being made a blasted fool of. You&rsquo;re jolly well
coming to Paris with me on Saturday or you can take the consequences.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her cheeks were red with anger, and when she answered her voice had the hard
commonness which she concealed generally by a genteel enunciation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never liked you, not from the beginning, but you forced yourself on
me, I always hated it when you kissed me. I wouldn&rsquo;t let you touch me now
not if I was starving.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip tried to swallow the food on his plate, but the muscles of his throat
refused to act. He gulped down something to drink and lit a cigarette. He was
trembling in every part. He did not speak. He waited for her to move, but she
sat in silence, staring at the white tablecloth. If they had been alone he
would have flung his arms round her and kissed her passionately; he fancied the
throwing back of her long white throat as he pressed upon her mouth with his
lips. They passed an hour without speaking, and at last Philip thought the
waiter began to stare at them curiously. He called for the bill.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall we go?&rdquo; he said then, in an even tone.
</p>

<p>
She did not reply, but gathered together her bag and her gloves. She put on her
coat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When are you seeing Griffiths again?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; she answered indifferently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better talk it over with him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She opened her bag mechanically and saw a piece of paper in it. She took it
out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the bill for this dress,&rdquo; she said hesitatingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What of it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I promised I&rsquo;d give her the money tomorrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Does that mean you won&rsquo;t pay for it after having told me I could
get it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It does.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask Harry,&rdquo; she said, flushing quickly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be glad to help you. He owes me seven pounds at the moment,
and he pawned his microscope last week, because he was so broke.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t think you can frighten me by that. I&rsquo;m quite
capable of earning my own living.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best thing you can do. I don&rsquo;t propose to give you
a farthing more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She thought of her rent due on Saturday and the baby&rsquo;s keep, but did not
say anything. They left the restaurant, and in the street Philip asked her:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall I call a cab for you? I&rsquo;m going to take a little
stroll.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got any money. I had to pay a bill this
afternoon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t hurt you to walk. If you want to see me tomorrow I shall
be in about tea-time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He took off his hat and sauntered away. He looked round in a moment and saw
that she was standing helplessly where he had left her, looking at the traffic.
He went back and with a laugh pressed a coin into her hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s two bob for you to get home with.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Before she could speak he hurried away.
</p>

<h2>LXXVI</h2>

<p>
Next day, in the afternoon, Philip sat in his room and wondered whether Mildred
would come. He had slept badly. He had spent the morning in the club of the
Medical School, reading one newspaper after another. It was the vacation and
few students he knew were in London, but he found one or two people to talk to,
he played a game of chess, and so wore out the tedious hours. After luncheon he
felt so tired, his head was aching so, that he went back to his lodgings and
lay down; he tried to read a novel. He had not seen Griffiths. He was not in
when Philip returned the night before; he heard him come back, but he did not
as usual look into Philip&rsquo;s room to see if he was asleep; and in the
morning Philip heard him go out early. It was clear that he wanted to avoid
him. Suddenly there was a light tap at his door. Philip sprang to his feet and
opened it. Mildred stood on the threshold. She did not move.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
He closed the door after her. She sat down. She hesitated to begin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you for giving me that two shillings last night,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She gave him a faint smile. It reminded Philip of the timid, ingratiating look
of a puppy that has been beaten for naughtiness and wants to reconcile himself
with his master.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been lunching with Harry,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you still want me to go away with you on Saturday, Philip, I&rsquo;ll
come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A quick thrill of triumph shot through his heart, but it was a sensation that
only lasted an instant; it was followed by a suspicion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because of the money?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Partly,&rdquo; she answered simply. &ldquo;Harry can&rsquo;t do
anything. He owes five weeks here, and he owes you seven pounds, and his
tailor&rsquo;s pressing him for money. He&rsquo;d pawn anything he could, but
he&rsquo;s pawned everything already. I had a job to put the woman off about my
new dress, and on Saturday there&rsquo;s the book at my lodgings, and I
can&rsquo;t get work in five minutes. It always means waiting some little time
till there&rsquo;s a vacancy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She said all this in an even, querulous tone, as though she were recounting the
injustices of fate, which had to be borne as part of the natural order of
things. Philip did not answer. He knew what she told him well enough.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You said partly,&rdquo; he observed at last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Harry says you&rsquo;ve been a brick to both of us. You&rsquo;ve
been a real good friend to him, he says, and you&rsquo;ve done for me what
p&rsquo;raps no other man would have done. We must do the straight thing, he
says. And he said what you said about him, that he&rsquo;s fickle by nature,
he&rsquo;s not like you, and I should be a fool to throw you away for him. He
won&rsquo;t last and you will, he says so himself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you WANT to come away with me?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked at her, and the corners of his mouth turned down in an expression of
misery. He had triumphed indeed, and he was going to have his way. He gave a
little laugh of derision at his own humiliation. She looked at him quickly, but
did not speak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve looked forward with all my soul to going away with you, and I
thought at last, after all that wretchedness, I was going to be happy…&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He did not finish what he was going to say. And then on a sudden, without
warning, Mildred broke into a storm of tears. She was sitting in the chair in
which Norah had sat and wept, and like her she hid her face on the back of it,
towards the side where there was a little bump formed by the sagging in the
middle, where the head had rested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not lucky with women,&rdquo; thought Philip.
</p>

<p>
Her thin body was shaken with sobs. Philip had never seen a woman cry with such
an utter abandonment. It was horribly painful, and his heart was torn. Without
realising what he did, he went up to her and put his arms round her; she did
not resist, but in her wretchedness surrendered herself to his comforting. He
whispered to her little words of solace. He scarcely knew what he was saying,
he bent over her and kissed her repeatedly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you awfully unhappy?&rdquo; he said at last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish I was dead,&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d died when
the baby come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her hat was in her way, and Philip took it off for her. He placed her head more
comfortably in the chair, and then he went and sat down at the table and looked
at her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is awful, love, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Fancy anyone
wanting to be in love.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Presently the violence of her sobbing diminished and she sat in the chair,
exhausted, with her head thrown back and her arms hanging by her side. She had
the grotesque look of one of those painters&rsquo; dummies used to hang
draperies on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you loved him so much as all that,&rdquo; said
Philip.
</p>

<p>
He understood Griffiths&rsquo; love well enough, for he put himself in
Griffiths&rsquo; place and saw with his eyes, touched with his hands; he was
able to think himself in Griffiths&rsquo; body, and he kissed her with his
lips, smiled at her with his smiling blue eyes. It was her emotion that
surprised him. He had never thought her capable of passion, and this was
passion: there was no mistaking it. Something seemed to give way in his heart;
it really felt to him as though something were breaking, and he felt strangely
weak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to make you unhappy. You needn&rsquo;t come away with
me if you don&rsquo;t want to. I&rsquo;ll give you the money all the
same.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I said I&rsquo;d come, and I&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good, if you&rsquo;re sick with love for him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the word. I&rsquo;m sick with love. I know it
won&rsquo;t last, just as well as he does, but just now…&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She paused and shut her eyes as though she were going to faint. A strange idea
came to Philip, and he spoke it as it came, without stopping to think it out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go away with him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can I? You know we haven&rsquo;t got the money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you the money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She sat up and looked at him. Her eyes began to shine, and the colour came into
her cheeks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps the best thing would be to get it over, and then you&rsquo;d
come back to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Now that he had made the suggestion he was sick with anguish, and yet the
torture of it gave him a strange, subtle sensation. She stared at him with open
eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, how could we, on your money? Harry wouldn&rsquo;t think of
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, he would, if you persuaded him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her objections made him insist, and yet he wanted her with all his heart to
refuse vehemently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a fiver, and you can go away from Saturday to
Monday. You could easily do that. On Monday he&rsquo;s going home till he takes
up his appointment at the North London.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Philip, do you mean that?&rdquo; she cried, clasping her hands.
&ldquo;If you could only let us go&mdash;I would love you so much afterwards,
I&rsquo;d do anything for you. I&rsquo;m sure I shall get over it if
you&rsquo;ll only do that. Would you really give us the money?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
She was entirely changed now. She began to laugh. He could see that she was
insanely happy. She got up and knelt down by Philip&rsquo;s side, taking his
hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are a brick, Philip. You&rsquo;re the best fellow I&rsquo;ve ever
known. Won&rsquo;t you be angry with me afterwards?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He shook his head, smiling, but with what agony in his heart!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;May I go and tell Harry now? And can I say to him that you don&rsquo;t
mind? He won&rsquo;t consent unless you promise it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Oh,
you don&rsquo;t know how I love him! And afterwards I&rsquo;ll do anything you
like. I&rsquo;ll come over to Paris with you or anywhere on Monday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She got up and put on her hat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to ask him if he&rsquo;ll take me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Already?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you want me to stay? I&rsquo;ll stay if you like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She sat down, but he gave a little laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, it doesn&rsquo;t matter, you&rsquo;d better go at once.
There&rsquo;s only one thing: I can&rsquo;t bear to see Griffiths just now, it
would hurt me too awfully. Say I have no ill-feeling towards him or anything
like that, but ask him to keep out of my way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; She sprang up and put on her gloves. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
let you know what he says.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better dine with me tonight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She put up her face for him to kiss her, and when he pressed his lips to hers
she threw her arms round his neck.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are a darling, Philip.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She sent him a note a couple of hours later to say that she had a headache and
could not dine with him. Philip had almost expected it. He knew that she was
dining with Griffiths. He was horribly jealous, but the sudden passion which
had seized the pair of them seemed like something that had come from the
outside, as though a god had visited them with it, and he felt himself
helpless. It seemed so natural that they should love one another. He saw all
the advantages that Griffiths had over himself and confessed that in
Mildred&rsquo;s place he would have done as Mildred did. What hurt him most was
Griffiths&rsquo; treachery; they had been such good friends, and Griffiths knew
how passionately devoted he was to Mildred: he might have spared him.
</p>

<p>
He did not see Mildred again till Friday; he was sick for a sight of her by
then; but when she came and he realised that he had gone out of her thoughts
entirely, for they were engrossed in Griffiths, he suddenly hated her. He saw
now why she and Griffiths loved one another, Griffiths was stupid, oh so
stupid! he had known that all along, but had shut his eyes to it, stupid and
empty-headed: that charm of his concealed an utter selfishness; he was willing
to sacrifice anyone to his appetites. And how inane was the life he led,
lounging about bars and drinking in music halls, wandering from one light amour
to another! He never read a book, he was blind to everything that was not
frivolous and vulgar; he had never a thought that was fine: the word most
common on his lips was smart; that was his highest praise for man or woman.
Smart! It was no wonder he pleased Mildred. They suited one another.
</p>

<p>
Philip talked to Mildred of things that mattered to neither of them. He knew
she wanted to speak of Griffiths, but he gave her no opportunity. He did not
refer to the fact that two evenings before she had put off dining with him on a
trivial excuse. He was casual with her, trying to make her think he was
suddenly grown indifferent; and he exercised peculiar skill in saying little
things which he knew would wound her; but which were so indefinite, so
delicately cruel, that she could not take exception to them. At last she got
up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I must be going off now,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I daresay you&rsquo;ve got a lot to do,&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
She held out her hand, he took it, said good-bye, and opened the door for her.
He knew what she wanted to speak about, and he knew also that his cold,
ironical air intimidated her. Often his shyness made him seem so frigid that
unintentionally he frightened people, and, having discovered this, he was able
when occasion arose to assume the same manner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t forgotten what you promised?&rdquo; she said at last,
as he held open the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;About the money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How much d&rsquo;you want?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He spoke with an icy deliberation which made his words peculiarly offensive.
Mildred flushed. He knew she hated him at that moment, and he wondered at the
self-control by which she prevented herself from flying out at him. He wanted
to make her suffer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the dress and the book tomorrow. That&rsquo;s all. Harry
won&rsquo;t come, so we shan&rsquo;t want money for that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip&rsquo;s heart gave a great thud against his ribs, and he let the door
handle go. The door swung to.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He says we couldn&rsquo;t, not on your money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A devil seized Philip, a devil of self-torture which was always lurking within
him, and, though with all his soul he wished that Griffiths and Mildred should
not go away together, he could not help himself; he set himself to persuade
Griffiths through her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why not, if I&rsquo;m willing,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I told him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should have thought if he really wanted to go he wouldn&rsquo;t
hesitate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not that, he wants to all right. He&rsquo;d go at once if
he had the money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s squeamish about it I&rsquo;ll give YOU the money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I said you&rsquo;d lend it if he liked, and we&rsquo;d pay it back as
soon as we could.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a change for you going on your knees to get a man to
take you away for a week-end.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is rather, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said, with a shameless little
laugh. It sent a cold shudder down Philip&rsquo;s spine.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you going to do then?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing. He&rsquo;s going home tomorrow. He must.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
That would be Philip&rsquo;s salvation. With Griffiths out of the way he could
get Mildred back. She knew no one in London, she would be thrown on to his
society, and when they were alone together he could soon make her forget this
infatuation. If he said nothing more he was safe. But he had a fiendish desire
to break down their scruples, he wanted to know how abominably they could
behave towards him; if he tempted them a little more they would yield, and he
took a fierce joy at the thought of their dishonour. Though every word he spoke
tortured him, he found in the torture a horrible delight.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It looks as if it were now or never.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I told him,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
There was a passionate note in her voice which struck Philip. He was biting his
nails in his nervousness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where were you thinking of going?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, to Oxford. He was at the &rsquo;Varsity there, you know. He said
he&rsquo;d show me the colleges.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip remembered that once he had suggested going to Oxford for the day, and
she had expressed firmly the boredom she felt at the thought of sights.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And it looks as if you&rsquo;d have fine weather. It ought to be very
jolly there just now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done all I could to persuade him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you have another try?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall I say you want us to go?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you must go as far as that,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
She paused for a minute or two, looking at him. Philip forced himself to look
at her in a friendly way. He hated her, he despised her, he loved her with all
his heart.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do, I&rsquo;ll go and see if he
can&rsquo;t arrange it. And then, if he says yes, I&rsquo;ll come and fetch the
money tomorrow. When shall you be in?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come back here after luncheon and wait.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you the money for your dress and your room now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He went to his desk and took out what money he had. The dress was six guineas;
there was besides her rent and her food, and the baby&rsquo;s keep for a week.
He gave her eight pounds ten.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thanks very much,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
She left him.

<h2>LXXVII</h2>

<p>
After lunching in the basement of the Medical School Philip went back to his
rooms. It was Saturday afternoon, and the landlady was cleaning the stairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is Mr. Griffiths in?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, sir. He went away this morning, soon after you went out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he coming back?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, sir. He&rsquo;s taken his luggage.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip wondered what this could mean. He took a book and began to read. It was
Burton&rsquo;s Journey to Meccah, which he had just got out of the Westminster
Public Library; and he read the first page, but could make no sense of it, for
his mind was elsewhere; he was listening all the time for a ring at the bell.
He dared not hope that Griffiths had gone away already, without Mildred, to his
home in Cumberland. Mildred would be coming presently for the money. He set his
teeth and read on; he tried desperately to concentrate his attention; the
sentences etched themselves in his brain by the force of his effort, but they
were distorted by the agony he was enduring. He wished with all his heart that
he had not made the horrible proposition to give them money; but now that he
had made it he lacked the strength to go back on it, not on Mildred&rsquo;s
account, but on his own. There was a morbid obstinacy in him which forced him
to do the thing he had determined. He discovered that the three pages he had
read had made no impression on him at all; and he went back and started from
the beginning: he found himself reading one sentence over and over again; and
now it weaved itself in with his thoughts, horribly, like some formula in a
nightmare. One thing he could do was to go out and keep away till midnight;
they could not go then; and he saw them calling at the house every hour to ask
if he was in. He enjoyed the thought of their disappointment. He repeated that
sentence to himself mechanically. But he could not do that. Let them come and
take the money, and he would know then to what depths of infamy it was possible
for men to descend. He could not read any more now. He simply could not see the
words. He leaned back in his chair, closing his eyes, and, numb with misery,
waited for Mildred.
</p>

<p>
The landlady came in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you see Mrs. Miller, sir?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Show her in.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip pulled himself together to receive her without any sign of what he was
feeling. He had an impulse to throw himself on his knees and seize her hands
and beg her not to go; but he knew there was no way of moving her; she would
tell Griffiths what he had said and how he acted. He was ashamed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, how about the little jaunt?&rdquo; he said gaily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going. Harry&rsquo;s outside. I told him you didn&rsquo;t
want to see him, so he&rsquo;s kept out of your way. But he wants to know if he
can come in just for a minute to say good-bye to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t see him,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
He could see she did not care if he saw Griffiths or not. Now that she was
there he wanted her to go quickly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here, here&rsquo;s the fiver. I&rsquo;d like you to go now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She took it and thanked him. She turned to leave the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When are you coming back?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, on Monday. Harry must go home then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He knew what he was going to say was humiliating, but he was broken down with
jealousy and desire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I shall see you, shan&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He could not help the note of appeal in his voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;ll let you know the moment I&rsquo;m back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He shook hands with her. Through the curtains he watched her jump into a
four-wheeler that stood at the door. It rolled away. Then he threw himself on
his bed and hid his face in his hands. He felt tears coming to his eyes, and he
was angry with himself; he clenched his hands and screwed up his body to
prevent them; but he could not; and great painful sobs were forced from him.
</p>

<p>
He got up at last, exhausted and ashamed, and washed his face. He mixed himself
a strong whiskey and soda. It made him feel a little better. Then he caught
sight of the tickets to Paris, which were on the chimney-piece, and, seizing
them, with an impulse of rage he flung them in the fire. He knew he could have
got the money back on them, but it relieved him to destroy them. Then he went
out in search of someone to be with. The club was empty. He felt he would go
mad unless he found someone to talk to; but Lawson was abroad; he went on to
Hayward&rsquo;s rooms: the maid who opened the door told him that he had gone
down to Brighton for the week-end. Then Philip went to a gallery and found it
was just closing. He did not know what to do. He was distracted. And he thought
of Griffiths and Mildred going to Oxford, sitting opposite one another in the
train, happy. He went back to his rooms, but they filled him with horror, he
had been so wretched in them; he tried once more to read Burton&rsquo;s book,
but, as he read, he told himself again and again what a fool he had been; it
was he who had made the suggestion that they should go away, he had offered the
money, he had forced it upon them; he might have known what would happen when
he introduced Griffiths to Mildred; his own vehement passion was enough to
arouse the other&rsquo;s desire. By this time they had reached Oxford. They
would put up in one of the lodging-houses in John Street; Philip had never been
to Oxford, but Griffiths had talked to him about it so much that he knew
exactly where they would go; and they would dine at the Clarendon: Griffiths
had been in the habit of dining there when he went on the spree. Philip got
himself something to eat in a restaurant near Charing Cross; he had made up his
mind to go to a play, and afterwards he fought his way into the pit of a
theatre at which one of Oscar Wilde&rsquo;s pieces was being performed. He
wondered if Mildred and Griffiths would go to a play that evening: they must
kill the evening somehow; they were too stupid, both of them to content
themselves with conversation: he got a fierce delight in reminding himself of
the vulgarity of their minds which suited them so exactly to one another. He
watched the play with an abstracted mind, trying to give himself gaiety by
drinking whiskey in each interval; he was unused to alcohol, and it affected
him quickly, but his drunkenness was savage and morose. When the play was over
he had another drink. He could not go to bed, he knew he would not sleep, and
he dreaded the pictures which his vivid imagination would place before him. He
tried not to think of them. He knew he had drunk too much. Now he was seized
with a desire to do horrible, sordid things; he wanted to roll himself in
gutters; his whole being yearned for beastliness; he wanted to grovel.
</p>

<p>
He walked up Piccadilly, dragging his club-foot, sombrely drunk, with rage and
misery clawing at his heart. He was stopped by a painted harlot, who put her
hand on his arm; he pushed her violently away with brutal words. He walked on a
few steps and then stopped. She would do as well as another. He was sorry he
had spoken so roughly to her. He went up to her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; he began.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go to hell,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
Philip laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I merely wanted to ask if you&rsquo;d do me the honour of supping with
me tonight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked at him with amazement, and hesitated for a while. She saw he was
drunk.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was amused that she should use a phrase he had heard so often on
Mildred&rsquo;s lips. He took her to one of the restaurants he had been in the
habit of going to with Mildred. He noticed as they walked along that she looked
down at his limb.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a club-foot,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Have you any
objection?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are a cure,&rdquo; she laughed.
</p>

<p>
When he got home his bones were aching, and in his head there was a hammering
that made him nearly scream. He took another whiskey and soda to steady
himself, and going to bed sank into a dreamless sleep till mid-day.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>LXXVIII</h2>

<p>
At last Monday came, and Philip thought his long torture was over. Looking out
the trains he found that the latest by which Griffiths could reach home that
night left Oxford soon after one, and he supposed that Mildred would take one
which started a few minutes later to bring her to London. His desire was to go
and meet it, but he thought Mildred would like to be left alone for a day;
perhaps she would drop him a line in the evening to say she was back, and if
not he would call at her lodgings next morning: his spirit was cowed. He felt a
bitter hatred for Griffiths, but for Mildred, notwithstanding all that had
passed, only a heart-rending desire. He was glad now that Hayward was not in
London on Saturday afternoon when, distraught, he went in search of human
comfort: he could not have prevented himself from telling him everything, and
Hayward would have been astonished at his weakness. He would despise him, and
perhaps be shocked or disgusted that he could envisage the possibility of
making Mildred his mistress after she had given herself to another man. What
did he care if it was shocking or disgusting? He was ready for any compromise,
prepared for more degrading humiliations still, if he could only gratify his
desire.
</p>

<p>
Towards the evening his steps took him against his will to the house in which
she lived, and he looked up at her window. It was dark. He did not venture to
ask if she was back. He was confident in her promise. But there was no letter
from her in the morning, and, when about mid-day he called, the maid told him
she had not arrived. He could not understand it. He knew that Griffiths would
have been obliged to go home the day before, for he was to be best man at a
wedding, and Mildred had no money. He turned over in his mind every possible
thing that might have happened. He went again in the afternoon and left a note,
asking her to dine with him that evening as calmly as though the events of the
last fortnight had not happened. He mentioned the place and time at which they
were to meet, and hoping against hope kept the appointment: though he waited
for an hour she did not come. On Wednesday morning he was ashamed to ask at the
house and sent a messenger-boy with a letter and instructions to bring back a
reply; but in an hour the boy came back with Philip&rsquo;s letter unopened and
the answer that the lady had not returned from the country. Philip was beside
himself. The last deception was more than he could bear. He repeated to himself
over and over again that he loathed Mildred, and, ascribing to Griffiths this
new disappointment, he hated him so much that he knew what was the delight of
murder: he walked about considering what a joy it would be to come upon him on
a dark night and stick a knife into his throat, just about the carotid artery,
and leave him to die in the street like a dog. Philip was out of his senses
with grief and rage. He did not like whiskey, but he drank to stupefy himself.
He went to bed drunk on the Tuesday and on the Wednesday night.
</p>

<p>
On Thursday morning he got up very late and dragged himself, blear-eyed and
sallow, into his sitting-room to see if there were any letters. A curious
feeling shot through his heart when he recognised the handwriting of Griffiths.
</p>

<p>
Dear old man:
</p>

<p>
I hardly know how to write to you and yet I feel I must write. I hope
you&rsquo;re not awfully angry with me. I know I oughtn&rsquo;t to have gone
away with Milly, but I simply couldn&rsquo;t help myself. She simply carried me
off my feet and I would have done anything to get her. When she told me you had
offered us the money to go I simply couldn&rsquo;t resist. And now it&rsquo;s
all over I&rsquo;m awfully ashamed of myself and I wish I hadn&rsquo;t been
such a fool. I wish you&rsquo;d write and say you&rsquo;re not angry with me,
and I want you to let me come and see you. I was awfully hurt at your telling
Milly you didn&rsquo;t want to see me. Do write me a line, there&rsquo;s a good
chap, and tell me you forgive me. It&rsquo;ll ease my conscience. I thought you
wouldn&rsquo;t mind or you wouldn&rsquo;t have offered the money. But I know I
oughtn&rsquo;t to have taken it. I came home on Monday and Milly wanted to stay
a couple of days at Oxford by herself. She&rsquo;s going back to London on
Wednesday, so by the time you receive this letter you will have seen her and I
hope everything will go off all right. Do write and say you forgive me. Please
write at once.<br/>
Yours ever,<br/>
Harry.
</p>

<p>
Philip tore up the letter furiously. He did not mean to answer it. He despised
Griffiths for his apologies, he had no patience with his prickings of
conscience: one could do a dastardly thing if one chose, but it was
contemptible to regret it afterwards. He thought the letter cowardly and
hypocritical. He was disgusted at its sentimentality.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It would be very easy if you could do a beastly thing,&rdquo; he
muttered to himself, &ldquo;and then say you were sorry, and that put it all
right again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He hoped with all his heart he would have the chance one day to do Griffiths a
bad turn.
</p>

<p>
But at all events he knew that Mildred was in town. He dressed hurriedly, not
waiting to shave, drank a cup of tea, and took a cab to her rooms. The cab
seemed to crawl. He was painfully anxious to see her, and unconsciously he
uttered a prayer to the God he did not believe in to make her receive him
kindly. He only wanted to forget. With beating heart he rang the bell. He
forgot all his suffering in the passionate desire to enfold her once more in
his arms.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is Mrs. Miller in?&rdquo; he asked joyously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; the maid answered.
</p>

<p>
He looked at her blankly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She came about an hour ago and took away her things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
For a moment he did not know what to say.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you give her my letter? Did she say where she was going?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then he understood that Mildred had deceived him again. She was not coming back
to him. He made an effort to save his face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, well, I daresay I shall hear from her. She may have sent a letter to
another address.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He turned away and went back hopeless to his rooms. He might have known that
she would do this; she had never cared for him, she had made a fool of him from
the beginning; she had no pity, she had no kindness, she had no charity. The
only thing was to accept the inevitable. The pain he was suffering was
horrible, he would sooner be dead than endure it; and the thought came to him
that it would be better to finish with the whole thing: he might throw himself
in the river or put his neck on a railway line; but he had no sooner set the
thought into words than he rebelled against it. His reason told him that he
would get over his unhappiness in time; if he tried with all his might he could
forget her; and it would be grotesque to kill himself on account of a vulgar
slut. He had only one life, and it was madness to fling it away. He FELT that
he would never overcome his passion, but he KNEW that after all it was only a
matter of time.
</p>

<p>
He would not stay in London. There everything reminded him of his unhappiness.
He telegraphed to his uncle that he was coming to Blackstable, and, hurrying to
pack, took the first train he could. He wanted to get away from the sordid
rooms in which he had endured so much suffering. He wanted to breathe clean
air. He was disgusted with himself. He felt that he was a little mad.
</p>

<p>
Since he was grown up Philip had been given the best spare room at the
vicarage. It was a corner-room and in front of one window was an old tree which
blocked the view, but from the other you saw, beyond the garden and the
vicarage field, broad meadows. Philip remembered the wall-paper from his
earliest years. On the walls were quaint water colours of the early Victorian
period by a friend of the Vicar&rsquo;s youth. They had a faded charm. The
dressing-table was surrounded by stiff muslin. There was an old tall-boy to put
your clothes in. Philip gave a sigh of pleasure; he had never realised that all
those things meant anything to him at all. At the vicarage life went on as it
had always done. No piece of furniture had been moved from one place to
another; the Vicar ate the same things, said the same things, went for the same
walk every day; he had grown a little fatter, a little more silent, a little
more narrow. He had become accustomed to living without his wife and missed her
very little. He bickered still with Josiah Graves. Philip went to see the
churchwarden. He was a little thinner, a little whiter, a little more austere;
he was autocratic still and still disapproved of candles on the altar. The
shops had still a pleasant quaintness; and Philip stood in front of that in
which things useful to seamen were sold, sea-boots and tarpaulins and tackle,
and remembered that he had felt there in his childhood the thrill of the sea
and the adventurous magic of the unknown.
</p>

<p>
He could not help his heart beating at each double knock of the postman in case
there might be a letter from Mildred sent on by his landlady in London; but he
knew that there would be none. Now that he could think it out more calmly he
understood that in trying to force Mildred to love him he had been attempting
the impossible. He did not know what it was that passed from a man to a woman,
from a woman to a man, and made one of them a slave: it was convenient to call
it the sexual instinct; but if it was no more than that, he did not understand
why it should occasion so vehement an attraction to one person rather than
another. It was irresistible: the mind could not battle with it; friendship,
gratitude, interest, had no power beside it. Because he had not attracted
Mildred sexually, nothing that he did had any effect upon her. The idea
revolted him; it made human nature beastly; and he felt suddenly that the
hearts of men were full of dark places. Because Mildred was indifferent to him
he had thought her sexless; her anaemic appearance and thin lips, the body with
its narrow hips and flat chest, the languor of her manner, carried out his
supposition; and yet she was capable of sudden passions which made her willing
to risk everything to gratify them. He had never understood her adventure with
Emil Miller: it had seemed so unlike her, and she had never been able to
explain it; but now that he had seen her with Griffiths he knew that just the
same thing had happened then: she had been carried off her feet by an
ungovernable desire. He tried to think out what those two men had which so
strangely attracted her. They both had a vulgar facetiousness which tickled her
simple sense of humour, and a certain coarseness of nature; but what took her
perhaps was the blatant sexuality which was their most marked characteristic.
She had a genteel refinement which shuddered at the facts of life, she looked
upon the bodily functions as indecent, she had all sorts of euphemisms for
common objects, she always chose an elaborate word as more becoming than a
simple one: the brutality of these men was like a whip on her thin white
shoulders, and she shuddered with voluptuous pain.
</p>

<p>
One thing Philip had made up his mind about. He would not go back to the
lodgings in which he had suffered. He wrote to his landlady and gave her
notice. He wanted to have his own things about him. He determined to take
unfurnished rooms: it would be pleasant and cheaper; and this was an urgent
consideration, for during the last year and a half he had spent nearly seven
hundred pounds. He must make up for it now by the most rigid economy. Now and
then he thought of the future with panic; he had been a fool to spend so much
money on Mildred; but he knew that if it were to come again he would act in the
same way. It amused him sometimes to consider that his friends, because he had
a face which did not express his feelings very vividly and a rather slow way of
moving, looked upon him as strong-minded, deliberate, and cool. They thought
him reasonable and praised his common sense; but he knew that his placid
expression was no more than a mask, assumed unconsciously, which acted like the
protective colouring of butterflies; and himself was astonished at the weakness
of his will. It seemed to him that he was swayed by every light emotion, as
though he were a leaf in the wind, and when passion seized him he was
powerless. He had no self-control. He merely seemed to possess it because he
was indifferent to many of the things which moved other people.
</p>

<p>
He considered with some irony the philosophy which he had developed for
himself, for it had not been of much use to him in the conjuncture he had
passed through; and he wondered whether thought really helped a man in any of
the critical affairs of life: it seemed to him rather that he was swayed by
some power alien to and yet within himself, which urged him like that great
wind of Hell which drove Paolo and Francesca ceaselessly on. He thought of what
he was going to do and, when the time came to act, he was powerless in the
grasp of instincts, emotions, he knew not what. He acted as though he were a
machine driven by the two forces of his environment and his personality; his
reason was someone looking on, observing the facts but powerless to interfere:
it was like those gods of Epicurus, who saw the doings of men from their
empyrean heights and had no might to alter one smallest particle of what
occurred.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>LXXIX</h2>

<p>
Philip went up to London a couple of days before the session began in order to
find himself rooms. He hunted about the streets that led out of the Westminster
Bridge Road, but their dinginess was distasteful to him; and at last he found
one in Kennington which had a quiet and old-world air. It reminded one a little
of the London which Thackeray knew on that side of the river, and in the
Kennington Road, through which the great barouche of the Newcomes must have
passed as it drove the family to the West of London, the plane-trees were
bursting into leaf. The houses in the street which Philip fixed upon were
two-storied, and in most of the windows was a notice to state that lodgings
were to let. He knocked at one which announced that the lodgings were
unfurnished, and was shown by an austere, silent woman four very small rooms,
in one of which there was a kitchen range and a sink. The rent was nine
shillings a week. Philip did not want so many rooms, but the rent was low and
he wished to settle down at once. He asked the landlady if she could keep the
place clean for him and cook his breakfast, but she replied that she had enough
work to do without that; and he was pleased rather than otherwise because she
intimated that she wished to have nothing more to do with him than to receive
his rent. She told him that, if he inquired at the grocer&rsquo;s round the
corner, which was also a post office, he might hear of a woman who would
&lsquo;do&rsquo; for him.
</p>

<p>
Philip had a little furniture which he had gathered as he went along, an
arm-chair that he had bought in Paris, and a table, a few drawings, and the
small Persian rug which Cronshaw had given him. His uncle had offered a fold-up
bed for which, now that he no longer let his house in August, he had no further
use; and by spending another ten pounds Philip bought himself whatever else was
essential. He spent ten shillings on putting a corn-coloured paper in the room
he was making his parlour; and he hung on the walls a sketch which Lawson had
given him of the Quai des Grands Augustins, and the photograph of the Odalisque
by Ingres and Manet&rsquo;s Olympia which in Paris had been the objects of his
contemplation while he shaved. To remind himself that he too had once been
engaged in the practice of art, he put up a charcoal drawing of the young
Spaniard Miguel Ajuria: it was the best thing he had ever done, a nude standing
with clenched hands, his feet gripping the floor with a peculiar force, and on
his face that air of determination which had been so impressive; and though
Philip after the long interval saw very well the defects of his work its
associations made him look upon it with tolerance. He wondered what had
happened to Miguel. There is nothing so terrible as the pursuit of art by those
who have no talent. Perhaps, worn out by exposure, starvation, disease, he had
found an end in some hospital, or in an access of despair had sought death in
the turbid Seine; but perhaps with his Southern instability he had given up the
struggle of his own accord, and now, a clerk in some office in Madrid, turned
his fervent rhetoric to politics and bull-fighting.
</p>

<p>
Philip asked Lawson and Hayward to come and see his new rooms, and they came,
one with a bottle of whiskey, the other with a pate de foie gras; and he was
delighted when they praised his taste. He would have invited the Scotch
stockbroker too, but he had only three chairs, and thus could entertain only a
definite number of guests. Lawson was aware that through him Philip had become
very friendly with Norah Nesbit and now remarked that he had run across her a
few days before.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She was asking how you were.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip flushed at the mention of her name (he could not get himself out of the
awkward habit of reddening when he was embarrassed), and Lawson looked at him
quizzically. Lawson, who now spent most of the year in London, had so far
surrendered to his environment as to wear his hair short and to dress himself
in a neat serge suit and a bowler hat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I gather that all is over between you,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not seen her for months.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She was looking rather nice. She had a very smart hat on with a lot of
white ostrich feathers on it. She must be doing pretty well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip changed the conversation, but he kept thinking of her, and after an
interval, when the three of them were talking of something else, he asked
suddenly:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you gather that Norah was angry with me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not a bit. She talked very nicely of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got half a mind to go and see her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t eat you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip had thought of Norah often. When Mildred left him his first thought was
of her, and he told himself bitterly that she would never have treated him so.
His impulse was to go to her; he could depend on her pity; but he was ashamed:
she had been good to him always, and he had treated her abominably.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d only had the sense to stick to her!&rdquo; he said to
himself, afterwards, when Lawson and Hayward had gone and he was smoking a last
pipe before going to bed.
</p>

<p>
He remembered the pleasant hours they had spent together in the cosy
sitting-room in Vincent Square, their visits to galleries and to the play, and
the charming evenings of intimate conversation. He recollected her solicitude
for his welfare and her interest in all that concerned him. She had loved him
with a love that was kind and lasting, there was more than sensuality in it, it
was almost maternal; he had always known that it was a precious thing for which
with all his soul he should thank the gods. He made up his mind to throw
himself on her mercy. She must have suffered horribly, but he felt she had the
greatness of heart to forgive him: she was incapable of malice. Should he write
to her? No. He would break in on her suddenly and cast himself at her
feet&mdash;he knew that when the time came he would feel too shy to perform
such a dramatic gesture, but that was how he liked to think of it&mdash;and
tell her that if she would take him back she might rely on him for ever. He was
cured of the hateful disease from which he had suffered, he knew her worth, and
now she might trust him. His imagination leaped forward to the future. He
pictured himself rowing with her on the river on Sundays; he would take her to
Greenwich, he had never forgotten that delightful excursion with Hayward, and
the beauty of the Port of London remained a permanent treasure in his
recollection; and on the warm summer afternoons they would sit in the Park
together and talk: he laughed to himself as he remembered her gay chatter,
which poured out like a brook bubbling over little stones, amusing, flippant,
and full of character. The agony he had suffered would pass from his mind like
a bad dream.
</p>

<p>
But when next day, about tea-time, an hour at which he was pretty certain to
find Norah at home, he knocked at her door his courage suddenly failed him. Was
it possible for her to forgive him? It would be abominable of him to force
himself on her presence. The door was opened by a maid new since he had been in
the habit of calling every day, and he inquired if Mrs. Nesbit was in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you ask her if she could see Mr. Carey?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The maid ran upstairs and in a moment clattered down again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you step up, please, sir. Second floor front.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Philip, with a slight smile.
</p>

<p>
He went with a fluttering heart. He knocked at the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said the well-known, cheerful voice.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to say come in to a new life of peace and happiness. When he entered
Norah stepped forward to greet him. She shook hands with him as if they had
parted the day before. A man stood up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Carey&mdash;Mr. Kingsford.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip, bitterly disappointed at not finding her alone, sat down and took stock
of the stranger. He had never heard her mention his name, but he seemed to
Philip to occupy his chair as though he were very much at home. He was a man of
forty, clean-shaven, with long fair hair very neatly plastered down, and the
reddish skin and pale, tired eyes which fair men get when their youth is
passed. He had a large nose, a large mouth; the bones of his face were
prominent, and he was heavily made; he was a man of more than average height,
and broad-shouldered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was wondering what had become of you,&rdquo; said Norah, in her
sprightly manner. &ldquo;I met Mr. Lawson the other day&mdash;did he tell
you?&mdash;and I informed him that it was really high time you came to see me
again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip could see no shadow of embarrassment in her countenance, and he admired
the use with which she carried off an encounter of which himself felt the
intense awkwardness. She gave him tea. She was about to put sugar in it when he
stopped her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How stupid of me!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I forgot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He did not believe that. She must remember quite well that he never took sugar
in his tea. He accepted the incident as a sign that her nonchalance was
affected.
</p>

<p>
The conversation which Philip had interrupted went on, and presently he began
to feel a little in the way. Kingsford took no particular notice of him. He
talked fluently and well, not without humour, but with a slightly dogmatic
manner: he was a journalist, it appeared, and had something amusing to say on
every topic that was touched upon; but it exasperated Philip to find himself
edged out of the conversation. He was determined to stay the visitor out. He
wondered if he admired Norah. In the old days they had often talked of the men
who wanted to flirt with her and had laughed at them together. Philip tried to
bring back the conversation to matters which only he and Norah knew about, but
each time the journalist broke in and succeeded in drawing it away to a subject
upon which Philip was forced to be silent. He grew faintly angry with Norah,
for she must see he was being made ridiculous; but perhaps she was inflicting
this upon him as a punishment, and with this thought he regained his good
humour. At last, however, the clock struck six, and Kingsford got up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
Norah shook hands with him, and accompanied him to the landing. She shut the
door behind her and stood outside for a couple of minutes. Philip wondered what
they were talking about.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who is Mr. Kingsford?&rdquo; he asked cheerfully, when she returned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s the editor of one of Harmsworth&rsquo;s Magazines.
He&rsquo;s been taking a good deal of my work lately.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought he was never going.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you stayed. I wanted to have a talk with you.&rdquo; She
curled herself into the large arm-chair, feet and all, in a way her small size
made possible, and lit a cigarette. He smiled when he saw her assume the
attitude which had always amused him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You look just like a cat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She gave him a flash of her dark, fine eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I really ought to break myself of the habit. It&rsquo;s absurd to behave
like a child when you&rsquo;re my age, but I&rsquo;m comfortable with my legs
under me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully jolly to be sitting in this room again,&rdquo; said
Philip happily. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;ve missed it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why on earth didn&rsquo;t you come before?&rdquo; she asked gaily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was afraid to,&rdquo; he said, reddening.
</p>

<p>
She gave him a look full of kindness. Her lips outlined a charming smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t have been.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He hesitated for a moment. His heart beat quickly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you remember the last time we met? I treated you awfully
badly&mdash;I&rsquo;m dreadfully ashamed of myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked at him steadily. She did not answer. He was losing his head; he
seemed to have come on an errand of which he was only now realising the
outrageousness. She did not help him, and he could only blurt out bluntly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can you ever forgive me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then impetuously he told her that Mildred had left him and that his unhappiness
had been so great that he almost killed himself. He told her of all that had
happened between them, of the birth of the child, and of the meeting with
Griffiths, of his folly and his trust and his immense deception. He told her
how often he had thought of her kindness and of her love, and how bitterly he
had regretted throwing it away: he had only been happy when he was with her,
and he knew now how great was her worth. His voice was hoarse with emotion.
Sometimes he was so ashamed of what he was saying that he spoke with his eyes
fixed on the ground. His face was distorted with pain, and yet he felt it a
strange relief to speak. At last he finished. He flung himself back in his
chair, exhausted, and waited. He had concealed nothing, and even, in his
self-abasement, he had striven to make himself more despicable than he had
really been. He was surprised that she did not speak, and at last he raised his
eyes. She was not looking at him. Her face was quite white, and she seemed to
be lost in thought.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got anything to say to me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She started and reddened.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve had a rotten time,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dreadfully sorry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She seemed about to go on, but she stopped, and again he waited. At length she
seemed to force herself to speak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m engaged to be married to Mr. Kingsford.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me at once?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You
needn&rsquo;t have allowed me to humiliate myself before you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I couldn&rsquo;t stop you…. I met him soon after
you&rdquo;&mdash;she seemed to search for an expression that should not wound
him&mdash;&ldquo;told me your friend had come back. I was very wretched for a
bit, he was extremely kind to me. He knew someone had made me suffer, of course
he doesn&rsquo;t know it was you, and I don&rsquo;t know what I should have
done without him. And suddenly I felt I couldn&rsquo;t go on working, working,
working; I was so tired, I felt so ill. I told him about my husband. He offered
to give me the money to get my divorce if I would marry him as soon as I could.
He had a very good job, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be necessary for me to do
anything unless I wanted to. He was so fond of me and so anxious to take care
of me. I was awfully touched. And now I&rsquo;m very, very fond of him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you got your divorce then?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the decree nisi. It&rsquo;ll be made absolute in July,
and then we are going to be married at once.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
For some time Philip did not say anything.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish I hadn&rsquo;t made such a fool of myself,&rdquo; he muttered at
length.
</p>

<p>
He was thinking of his long, humiliating confession. She looked at him
curiously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You were never really in love with me,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not very pleasant being in love.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But he was always able to recover himself quickly, and, getting up now and
holding out his hand, he said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll be very happy. After all, it&rsquo;s the best thing
that could have happened to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked a little wistfully at him as she took his hand and held it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come and see me again, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head. &ldquo;It would make me too
envious to see you happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He walked slowly away from her house. After all she was right when she said he
had never loved her. He was disappointed, irritated even, but his vanity was
more affected than his heart. He knew that himself. And presently he grew
conscious that the gods had played a very good practical joke on him, and he
laughed at himself mirthlessly. It is not very comfortable to have the gift of
being amused at one&rsquo;s own absurdity.
</p>

<h2>LXXX</h2>

<p>
For the next three months Philip worked on subjects which were new to him. The
unwieldy crowd which had entered the Medical School nearly two years before had
thinned out: some had left the hospital, finding the examinations more
difficult to pass than they expected, some had been taken away by parents who
had not foreseen the expense of life in London, and some had drifted away to
other callings. One youth whom Philip knew had devised an ingenious plan to
make money; he had bought things at sales and pawned them, but presently found
it more profitable to pawn goods bought on credit; and it had caused a little
excitement at the hospital when someone pointed out his name in police-court
proceedings. There had been a remand, then assurances on the part of a harassed
father, and the young man had gone out to bear the White Man&rsquo;s Burden
overseas. The imagination of another, a lad who had never before been in a town
at all, fell to the glamour of music-halls and bar parlours; he spent his time
among racing-men, tipsters, and trainers, and now was become a
book-maker&rsquo;s clerk. Philip had seen him once in a bar near Piccadilly
Circus in a tight-waisted coat and a brown hat with a broad, flat brim. A
third, with a gift for singing and mimicry, who had achieved success at the
smoking concerts of the Medical School by his imitation of notorious comedians,
had abandoned the hospital for the chorus of a musical comedy. Still another,
and he interested Philip because his uncouth manner and interjectional speech
did not suggest that he was capable of any deep emotion, had felt himself
stifle among the houses of London. He grew haggard in shut-in spaces, and the
soul he knew not he possessed struggled like a sparrow held in the hand, with
little frightened gasps and a quick palpitation of the heart: he yearned for
the broad skies and the open, desolate places among which his childhood had
been spent; and he walked off one day, without a word to anybody, between one
lecture and another; and the next thing his friends heard was that he had
thrown up medicine and was working on a farm.
</p>

<p>
Philip attended now lectures on medicine and on surgery. On certain mornings in
the week he practised bandaging on out-patients glad to earn a little money,
and he was taught auscultation and how to use the stethoscope. He learned
dispensing. He was taking the examination in Materia Medica in July, and it
amused him to play with various drugs, concocting mixtures, rolling pills, and
making ointments. He seized avidly upon anything from which he could extract a
suggestion of human interest.
</p>

<p>
He saw Griffiths once in the distance, but, not to have the pain of cutting him
dead, avoided him. Philip had felt a certain self-consciousness with
Griffiths&rsquo; friends, some of whom were now friends of his, when he
realised they knew of his quarrel with Griffiths and surmised they were aware
of the reason. One of them, a very tall fellow, with a small head and a languid
air, a youth called Ramsden, who was one of Griffiths&rsquo; most faithful
admirers, copied his ties, his boots, his manner of talking and his gestures,
told Philip that Griffiths was very much hurt because Philip had not answered
his letter. He wanted to be reconciled with him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has he asked you to give me the message?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, no. I&rsquo;m saying this entirely on my own,&rdquo; said Ramsden.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s awfully sorry for what he did, and he says you always behaved
like a perfect brick to him. I know he&rsquo;d be glad to make it up. He
doesn&rsquo;t come to the hospital because he&rsquo;s afraid of meeting you,
and he thinks you&rsquo;d cut him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It makes him feel rather wretched, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can bear the trifling inconvenience that he feels with a good deal of
fortitude,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do anything he can to make it up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How childish and hysterical! Why should he care? I&rsquo;m a very
insignificant person, and he can do very well without my company. I&rsquo;m not
interested in him any more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ramsden thought Philip hard and cold. He paused for a moment or two, looking
about him in a perplexed way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Harry wishes to God he&rsquo;d never had anything to do with the
woman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Does he?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
He spoke with an indifference which he was satisfied with. No one could have
guessed how violently his heart was beating. He waited impatiently for Ramsden
to go on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ve quite got over it now, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I?&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;Quite.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Little by little he discovered the history of Mildred&rsquo;s relations with
Griffiths. He listened with a smile on his lips, feigning an equanimity which
quite deceived the dull-witted boy who talked to him. The week-end she spent
with Griffiths at Oxford inflamed rather than extinguished her sudden passion;
and when Griffiths went home, with a feeling that was unexpected in her she
determined to stay in Oxford by herself for a couple of days, because she had
been so happy in it. She felt that nothing could induce her to go back to
Philip. He revolted her. Griffiths was taken aback at the fire he had aroused,
for he had found his two days with her in the country somewhat tedious; and he
had no desire to turn an amusing episode into a tiresome affair. She made him
promise to write to her, and, being an honest, decent fellow, with natural
politeness and a desire to make himself pleasant to everybody, when he got home
he wrote her a long and charming letter. She answered it with reams of passion,
clumsy, for she had no gift of expression, ill-written, and vulgar; the letter
bored him, and when it was followed next day by another, and the day after by a
third, he began to think her love no longer flattering but alarming. He did not
answer; and she bombarded him with telegrams, asking him if he were ill and had
received her letters; she said his silence made her dreadfully anxious. He was
forced to write, but he sought to make his reply as casual as was possible
without being offensive: he begged her not to wire, since it was difficult to
explain telegrams to his mother, an old-fashioned person for whom a telegram
was still an event to excite tremor. She answered by return of post that she
must see him and announced her intention to pawn things (she had the
dressing-case which Philip had given her as a wedding-present and could raise
eight pounds on that) in order to come up and stay at the market town four
miles from which was the village in which his father practised. This frightened
Griffiths; and he, this time, made use of the telegraph wires to tell her that
she must do nothing of the kind. He promised to let her know the moment he came
up to London, and, when he did, found that she had already been asking for him
at the hospital at which he had an appointment. He did not like this, and, on
seeing her, told Mildred that she was not to come there on any pretext; and
now, after an absence of three weeks, he found that she bored him quite
decidedly; he wondered why he had ever troubled about her, and made up his mind
to break with her as soon as he could. He was a person who dreaded quarrels,
nor did he want to give pain; but at the same time he had other things to do,
and he was quite determined not to let Mildred bother him. When he met her he
was pleasant, cheerful, amusing, affectionate; he invented convincing excuses
for the interval since last he had seen her; but he did everything he could to
avoid her. When she forced him to make appointments he sent telegrams to her at
the last moment to put himself off; and his landlady (the first three months of
his appointment he was spending in rooms) had orders to say he was out when
Mildred called. She would waylay him in the street and, knowing she had been
waiting about for him to come out of the hospital for a couple of hours, he
would give her a few charming, friendly words and bolt off with the excuse that
he had a business engagement. He grew very skilful in slipping out of the
hospital unseen. Once, when he went back to his lodgings at midnight, he saw a
woman standing at the area railings and suspecting who it was went to beg a
shake-down in Ramsden&rsquo;s rooms; next day the landlady told him that
Mildred had sat crying on the doorsteps for hours, and she had been obliged to
tell her at last that if she did not go away she would send for a policeman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I tell you, my boy,&rdquo; said Ramsden, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re jolly well
out of it. Harry says that if he&rsquo;d suspected for half a second she was
going to make such a blooming nuisance of herself he&rsquo;d have seen himself
damned before he had anything to do with her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip thought of her sitting on that doorstep through the long hours of the
night. He saw her face as she looked up dully at the landlady who sent her
away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder what she&rsquo;s doing now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s got a job somewhere, thank God. That keeps her busy all
day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The last thing he heard, just before the end of the summer session, was that
Griffiths, urbanity had given way at length under the exasperation of the
constant persecution. He had told Mildred that he was sick of being pestered,
and she had better take herself off and not bother him again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was the only thing he could do,&rdquo; said Ramsden. &ldquo;It was
getting a bit too thick.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it all over then?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he hasn&rsquo;t seen her for ten days. You know, Harry&rsquo;s
wonderful at dropping people. This is about the toughest nut he&rsquo;s ever
had to crack, but he&rsquo;s cracked it all right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then Philip heard nothing more of her at all. She vanished into the vast
anonymous mass of the population of London.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>LXXXI</h2>

<p>
At the beginning of the winter session Philip became an out-patients&rsquo;
clerk. There were three assistant-physicians who took out-patients, two days a
week each, and Philip put his name down for Dr. Tyrell. He was popular with the
students, and there was some competition to be his clerk. Dr. Tyrell was a
tall, thin man of thirty-five, with a very small head, red hair cut short, and
prominent blue eyes: his face was bright scarlet. He talked well in a pleasant
voice, was fond of a little joke, and treated the world lightly. He was a
successful man, with a large consulting practice and a knighthood in prospect.
From commerce with students and poor people he had the patronising air, and
from dealing always with the sick he had the healthy man&rsquo;s jovial
condescension, which some consultants achieve as the professional manner. He
made the patient feel like a boy confronted by a jolly schoolmaster; his
illness was an absurd piece of naughtiness which amused rather than irritated.
</p>

<p>
The student was supposed to attend in the out-patients&rsquo; room every day,
see cases, and pick up what information he could; but on the days on which he
clerked his duties were a little more definite. At that time the
out-patients&rsquo; department at St. Luke&rsquo;s consisted of three rooms,
leading into one another, and a large, dark waiting-room with massive pillars
of masonry and long benches. Here the patients waited after having been given
their &lsquo;letters&rsquo; at mid-day; and the long rows of them, bottles and
gallipots in hand, some tattered and dirty, others decent enough, sitting in
the dimness, men and women of all ages, children, gave one an impression which
was weird and horrible. They suggested the grim drawings of Daumier. All the
rooms were painted alike, in salmon-colour with a high dado of maroon; and
there was in them an odour of disinfectants, mingling as the afternoon wore on
with the crude stench of humanity. The first room was the largest and in the
middle of it were a table and an office chair for the physician; on each side
of this were two smaller tables, a little lower: at one of these sat the
house-physician and at the other the clerk who took the &lsquo;book&rsquo; for
the day. This was a large volume in which were written down the name, age, sex,
profession, of the patient and the diagnosis of his disease.
</p>

<p>
At half past one the house-physician came in, rang the bell, and told the
porter to send in the old patients. There were always a good many of these, and
it was necessary to get through as many of them as possible before Dr. Tyrell
came at two. The H.P. with whom Philip came in contact was a dapper little man,
excessively conscious of his importance: he treated the clerks with
condescension and patently resented the familiarity of older students who had
been his contemporaries and did not use him with the respect he felt his
present position demanded. He set about the cases. A clerk helped him. The
patients streamed in. The men came first. Chronic bronchitis, &ldquo;a nasty
&rsquo;acking cough,&rdquo; was what they chiefly suffered from; one went to
the H.P. and the other to the clerk, handing in their letters: if they were
going on well the words Rep 14 were written on them, and they went to the
dispensary with their bottles or gallipots in order to have medicine given them
for fourteen days more. Some old stagers held back so that they might be seen
by the physician himself, but they seldom succeeded in this; and only three or
four, whose condition seemed to demand his attention, were kept.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Tyrell came in with quick movements and a breezy manner. He reminded one
slightly of a clown leaping into the arena of a circus with the cry: Here we
are again. His air seemed to indicate: What&rsquo;s all this nonsense about
being ill? I&rsquo;ll soon put that right. He took his seat, asked if there
were any old patients for him to see, rapidly passed them in review, looking at
them with shrewd eyes as he discussed their symptoms, cracked a joke (at which
all the clerks laughed heartily) with the H.P., who laughed heartily too but
with an air as if he thought it was rather impudent for the clerks to laugh,
remarked that it was a fine day or a hot one, and rang the bell for the porter
to show in the new patients.
</p>

<p>
They came in one by one and walked up to the table at which sat Dr. Tyrell.
They were old men and young men and middle-aged men, mostly of the labouring
class, dock labourers, draymen, factory hands, barmen; but some, neatly
dressed, were of a station which was obviously superior, shop-assistants,
clerks, and the like. Dr. Tyrell looked at these with suspicion. Sometimes they
put on shabby clothes in order to pretend they were poor; but he had a keen eye
to prevent what he regarded as fraud and sometimes refused to see people who,
he thought, could well pay for medical attendance. Women were the worst
offenders and they managed the thing more clumsily. They would wear a cloak and
a skirt which were almost in rags, and neglect to take the rings off their
fingers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you can afford to wear jewellery you can afford a doctor. A hospital
is a charitable institution,&rdquo; said Dr. Tyrell.
</p>

<p>
He handed back the letter and called for the next case.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve got my letter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a hang about your letter; you get out. You&rsquo;ve
got no business to come and steal the time which is wanted by the really
poor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The patient retired sulkily, with an angry scowl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll probably write a letter to the papers on the gross
mismanagement of the London hospitals,&rdquo; said Dr. Tyrell, with a smile, as
he took the next paper and gave the patient one of his shrewd glances.
</p>

<p>
Most of them were under the impression that the hospital was an institution of
the state, for which they paid out of the rates, and took the attendance they
received as a right they could claim. They imagined the physician who gave them
his time was heavily paid.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Tyrell gave each of his clerks a case to examine. The clerk took the
patient into one of the inner rooms; they were smaller, and each had a couch in
it covered with black horse-hair: he asked his patient a variety of questions,
examined his lungs, his heart, and his liver, made notes of fact on the
hospital letter, formed in his own mind some idea of the diagnosis, and then
waited for Dr. Tyrell to come in. This he did, followed by a small crowd of
students, when he had finished the men, and the clerk read out what he had
learned. The physician asked him one or two questions, and examined the patient
himself. If there was anything interesting to hear students applied their
stethoscope: you would see a man with two or three to the chest, and two
perhaps to his back, while others waited impatiently to listen. The patient
stood among them a little embarrassed, but not altogether displeased to find
himself the centre of attention: he listened confusedly while Dr. Tyrell
discoursed glibly on the case. Two or three students listened again to
recognise the murmur or the crepitation which the physician described, and then
the man was told to put on his clothes.
</p>

<p>
When the various cases had been examined Dr. Tyrell went back into the large
room and sat down again at his desk. He asked any student who happened to be
standing near him what he would prescribe for a patient he had just seen. The
student mentioned one or two drugs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would you?&rdquo; said Dr. Tyrell. &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s original at
all events. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll be rash.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This always made the students laugh, and with a twinkle of amusement at his own
bright humour the physician prescribed some other drug than that which the
student had suggested. When there were two cases of exactly the same sort and
the student proposed the treatment which the physician had ordered for the
first, Dr. Tyrell exercised considerable ingenuity in thinking of something
else. Sometimes, knowing that in the dispensary they were worked off their legs
and preferred to give the medicines which they had all ready, the good hospital
mixtures which had been found by the experience of years to answer their
purpose so well, he amused himself by writing an elaborate prescription.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll give the dispenser something to do. If we go on prescribing
mist: alb: he&rsquo;ll lose his cunning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The students laughed, and the doctor gave them a circular glance of enjoyment
in his joke. Then he touched the bell and, when the porter poked his head in,
said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Old women, please.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He leaned back in his chair, chatting with the H.P. while the porter herded
along the old patients. They came in, strings of anaemic girls, with large
fringes and pallid lips, who could not digest their bad, insufficient food; old
ladies, fat and thin, aged prematurely by frequent confinements, with winter
coughs; women with this, that, and the other, the matter with them. Dr. Tyrell
and his house-physician got through them quickly. Time was getting on, and the
air in the small room was growing more sickly. The physician looked at his
watch.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are there many new women today?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A good few, I think,&rdquo; said the H.P.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better have them in. You can go on with the old ones.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They entered. With the men the most common ailments were due to the excessive
use of alcohol, but with the women they were due to defective nourishment. By
about six o&rsquo;clock they were finished. Philip, exhausted by standing all
the time, by the bad air, and by the attention he had given, strolled over with
his fellow-clerks to the Medical School to have tea. He found the work of
absorbing interest. There was humanity there in the rough, the materials the
artist worked on; and Philip felt a curious thrill when it occurred to him that
he was in the position of the artist and the patients were like clay in his
hands. He remembered with an amused shrug of the shoulders his life in Paris,
absorbed in colour, tone, values, Heaven knows what, with the aim of producing
beautiful things: the directness of contact with men and women gave a thrill of
power which he had never known. He found an endless excitement in looking at
their faces and hearing them speak; they came in each with his peculiarity,
some shuffling uncouthly, some with a little trip, others with heavy, slow
tread, some shyly. Often you could guess their trades by the look of them. You
learnt in what way to put your questions so that they should be understood, you
discovered on what subjects nearly all lied, and by what inquiries you could
extort the truth notwithstanding. You saw the different way people took the
same things. The diagnosis of dangerous illness would be accepted by one with a
laugh and a joke, by another with dumb despair. Philip found that he was less
shy with these people than he had ever been with others; he felt not exactly
sympathy, for sympathy suggests condescension; but he felt at home with them.
He found that he was able to put them at their ease, and, when he had been
given a case to find out what he could about it, it seemed to him that the
patient delivered himself into his hands with a peculiar confidence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he thought to himself, with a smile, &ldquo;perhaps
I&rsquo;m cut out to be a doctor. It would be rather a lark if I&rsquo;d hit
upon the one thing I&rsquo;m fit for.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It seemed to Philip that he alone of the clerks saw the dramatic interest of
those afternoons. To the others men and women were only cases, good if they
were complicated, tiresome if obvious; they heard murmurs and were astonished
at abnormal livers; an unexpected sound in the lungs gave them something to
talk about. But to Philip there was much more. He found an interest in just
looking at them, in the shape of their heads and their hands, in the look of
their eyes and the length of their noses. You saw in that room human nature
taken by surprise, and often the mask of custom was torn off rudely, showing
you the soul all raw. Sometimes you saw an untaught stoicism which was
profoundly moving. Once Philip saw a man, rough and illiterate, told his case
was hopeless; and, self-controlled himself, he wondered at the splendid
instinct which forced the fellow to keep a stiff upper-lip before strangers.
But was it possible for him to be brave when he was by himself, face to face
with his soul, or would he then surrender to despair? Sometimes there was
tragedy. Once a young woman brought her sister to be examined, a girl of
eighteen, with delicate features and large blue eyes, fair hair that sparkled
with gold when a ray of autumn sunshine touched it for a moment, and a skin of
amazing beauty. The students&rsquo; eyes went to her with little smiles. They
did not often see a pretty girl in these dingy rooms. The elder woman gave the
family history, father and mother had died of phthisis, a brother and a sister,
these two were the only ones left. The girl had been coughing lately and losing
weight. She took off her blouse and the skin of her neck was like milk. Dr.
Tyrell examined her quietly, with his usual rapid method; he told two or three
of his clerks to apply their stethoscopes to a place he indicated with his
finger; and then she was allowed to dress. The sister was standing a little
apart and she spoke to him in a low voice, so that the girl should not hear.
Her voice trembled with fear.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t got it, doctor, has she?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s no doubt about it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She was the last one. When she goes I shan&rsquo;t have anybody.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She began to cry, while the doctor looked at her gravely; he thought she too
had the type; she would not make old bones either. The girl turned round and
saw her sister&rsquo;s tears. She understood what they meant. The colour fled
from her lovely face and tears fell down her cheeks. The two stood for a minute
or two, crying silently, and then the older, forgetting the indifferent crowd
that watched them, went up to her, took her in her arms, and rocked her gently
to and fro as if she were a baby.
</p>

<p>
When they were gone a student asked:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How long d&rsquo;you think she&rsquo;ll last, sir?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dr. Tyrell shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Her brother and sister died within three months of the first symptoms.
She&rsquo;ll do the same. If they were rich one might do something. You
can&rsquo;t tell these people to go to St. Moritz. Nothing can be done for
them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Once a man who was strong and in all the power of his manhood came because a
persistent aching troubled him and his club-doctor did not seem to do him any
good; and the verdict for him too was death, not the inevitable death that
horrified and yet was tolerable because science was helpless before it, but the
death which was inevitable because the man was a little wheel in the great
machine of a complex civilisation, and had as little power of changing the
circumstances as an automaton. Complete rest was his only chance. The physician
did not ask impossibilities.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You ought to get some very much lighter job.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no light jobs in my business.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, if you go on like this you&rsquo;ll kill yourself. You&rsquo;re
very ill.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you mean to say I&rsquo;m going to die?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like to say that, but you&rsquo;re certainly unfit for
hard work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t work who&rsquo;s to keep the wife and the kids?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dr. Tyrell shrugged his shoulders. The dilemma had been presented to him a
hundred times. Time was pressing and there were many patients to be seen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll give you some medicine and you can come back in a week
and tell me how you&rsquo;re getting on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man took his letter with the useless prescription written upon it and
walked out. The doctor might say what he liked. He did not feel so bad that he
could not go on working. He had a good job and he could not afford to throw it
away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I give him a year,&rdquo; said Dr. Tyrell.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes there was comedy. Now and then came a flash of cockney humour, now
and then some old lady, a character such as Charles Dickens might have drawn,
would amuse them by her garrulous oddities. Once a woman came who was a member
of the ballet at a famous music-hall. She looked fifty, but gave her age as
twenty-eight. She was outrageously painted and ogled the students impudently
with large black eyes; her smiles were grossly alluring. She had abundant
self-confidence and treated Dr. Tyrell, vastly amused, with the easy
familiarity with which she might have used an intoxicated admirer. She had
chronic bronchitis, and told him it hindered her in the exercise of her
profession.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I should &rsquo;ave such a thing, upon my word I
don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve never &rsquo;ad a day&rsquo;s illness in my life.
You&rsquo;ve only got to look at me to know that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She rolled her eyes round the young men, with a long sweep of her painted
eyelashes, and flashed her yellow teeth at them. She spoke with a cockney
accent, but with an affectation of refinement which made every word a feast of
fun.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what they call a winter cough,&rdquo; answered Dr. Tyrell
gravely. &ldquo;A great many middle-aged women have it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I never! That is a nice thing to say to a lady. No one ever called
me middle-aged before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She opened her eyes very wide and cocked her head on one side, looking at him
with indescribable archness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is the disadvantage of our profession,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It
forces us sometimes to be ungallant.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She took the prescription and gave him one last, luscious smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will come and see me dance, dearie, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will indeed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He rang the bell for the next case.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am glad you gentlemen were here to protect me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But on the whole the impression was neither of tragedy nor of comedy. There was
no describing it. It was manifold and various; there were tears and laughter,
happiness and woe; it was tedious and interesting and indifferent; it was as
you saw it: it was tumultuous and passionate; it was grave; it was sad and
comic; it was trivial; it was simple and complex; joy was there and despair;
the love of mothers for their children, and of men for women; lust trailed
itself through the rooms with leaden feet, punishing the guilty and the
innocent, helpless wives and wretched children; drink seized men and women and
cost its inevitable price; death sighed in these rooms; and the beginning of
life, filling some poor girl with terror and shame, was diagnosed there. There
was neither good nor bad there. There were just facts. It was life.

<h2>LXXXII</h2>

<p>
Towards the end of the year, when Philip was bringing to a close his three
months as clerk in the out-patients&rsquo; department, he received a letter
from Lawson, who was in Paris.
</p>

<p>
Dear Philip,
</p>

<p>
Cronshaw is in London and would be glad to see you. He is living at 43 Hyde
Street, Soho. I don&rsquo;t know where it is, but I daresay you will be able to
find out. Be a brick and look after him a bit. He is very down on his luck. He
will tell you what he is doing. Things are going on here very much as usual.
Nothing seems to have changed since you were here. Clutton is back, but he has
become quite impossible. He has quarrelled with everybody. As far as I can make
out he hasn&rsquo;t got a cent, he lives in a little studio right away beyond
the Jardin des Plantes, but he won&rsquo;t let anybody see his work. He
doesn&rsquo;t show anywhere, so one doesn&rsquo;t know what he is doing. He may
be a genius, but on the other hand he may be off his head. By the way, I ran
against Flanagan the other day. He was showing Mrs. Flanagan round the Quarter.
He has chucked art and is now in popper&rsquo;s business. He seems to be
rolling. Mrs. Flanagan is very pretty and I&rsquo;m trying to work a portrait.
How much would you ask if you were me? I don&rsquo;t want to frighten them, and
then on the other hand I don&rsquo;t want to be such an ass as to ask L150 if
they&rsquo;re quite willing to give L300.
</p>

<p>
                                              Yours ever,<br/>
                                                   Frederick Lawson.
</p>

<p>
Philip wrote to Cronshaw and received in reply the following letter. It was
written on a half-sheet of common note-paper, and the flimsy envelope was
dirtier than was justified by its passage through the post.
</p>

<p>
Dear Carey,
</p>

<p>
Of course I remember you very well. I have an idea that I had some part in
rescuing you from the Slough of Despond in which myself am hopelessly immersed.
I shall be glad to see you. I am a stranger in a strange city and I am buffeted
by the philistines. It will be pleasant to talk of Paris. I do not ask you to
come and see me, since my lodging is not of a magnificence fit for the
reception of an eminent member of Monsieur Purgon&rsquo;s profession, but you
will find me eating modestly any evening between seven and eight at a
restaurant yclept Au Bon Plaisir in Dean Street.
</p>

<p>
                                          Your sincere<br/>
                                                  J. Cronshaw.
</p>

<p>
Philip went the day he received this letter. The restaurant, consisting of one
small room, was of the poorest class, and Cronshaw seemed to be its only
customer. He was sitting in the corner, well away from draughts, wearing the
same shabby great-coat which Philip had never seen him without, with his old
bowler on his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I eat here because I can be alone,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They are not
doing well; the only people who come are a few trollops and one or two waiters
out of a job; they are giving up business, and the food is execrable. But the
ruin of their fortunes is my advantage.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Cronshaw had before him a glass of absinthe. It was nearly three years since
they had met, and Philip was shocked by the change in his appearance. He had
been rather corpulent, but now he had a dried-up, yellow look: the skin of his
neck was loose and winkled; his clothes hung about him as though they had been
bought for someone else; and his collar, three or four sizes too large, added
to the slatternliness of his appearance. His hands trembled continually. Philip
remembered the handwriting which scrawled over the page with shapeless,
haphazard letters. Cronshaw was evidently very ill.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I eat little these days,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sick in
the morning. I&rsquo;m just having some soup for my dinner, and then I shall
have a bit of cheese.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip&rsquo;s glance unconsciously went to the absinthe, and Cronshaw, seeing
it, gave him the quizzical look with which he reproved the admonitions of
common sense.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have diagnosed my case, and you think it&rsquo;s very wrong of me to
drink absinthe.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve evidently got cirrhosis of the liver,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Evidently.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked at Philip in the way which had formerly had the power of making him
feel incredibly narrow. It seemed to point out that what he was thinking was
distressingly obvious; and when you have agreed with the obvious what more is
there to say? Philip changed the topic.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When are you going back to Paris?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going back to Paris. I&rsquo;m going to die.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The very naturalness with which he said this startled Philip. He thought of
half a dozen things to say, but they seemed futile. He knew that Cronshaw was a
dying man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you going to settle in London then?&rdquo; he asked lamely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is London to me? I am a fish out of water. I walk through the
crowded streets, men jostle me, and I seem to walk in a dead city. I felt that
I couldn&rsquo;t die in Paris. I wanted to die among my own people. I
don&rsquo;t know what hidden instinct drew me back at the last.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip knew of the woman Cronshaw had lived with and the two draggle-tailed
children, but Cronshaw had never mentioned them to him, and he did not like to
speak of them. He wondered what had happened to them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you talk of dying,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I had pneumonia a couple of winters ago, and they told me then it was a
miracle that I came through. It appears I&rsquo;m extremely liable to it, and
another bout will kill me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, what nonsense! You&rsquo;re not so bad as all that. You&rsquo;ve
only got to take precautions. Why don&rsquo;t you give up drinking?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t choose. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what a man does if
he&rsquo;s ready to take the consequences. Well, I&rsquo;m ready to take the
consequences. You talk glibly of giving up drinking, but it&rsquo;s the only
thing I&rsquo;ve got left now. What do you think life would be to me without
it? Can you understand the happiness I get out of my absinthe? I yearn for it;
and when I drink it I savour every drop, and afterwards I feel my soul swimming
in ineffable happiness. It disgusts you. You are a puritan and in your heart
you despise sensual pleasures. Sensual pleasures are the most violent and the
most exquisite. I am a man blessed with vivid senses, and I have indulged them
with all my soul. I have to pay the penalty now, and I am ready to pay.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip looked at him for a while steadily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
For a moment Cronshaw did not answer. He seemed to consider his reply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sometimes, when I&rsquo;m alone.&rdquo; He looked at Philip. &ldquo;You
think that&rsquo;s a condemnation? You&rsquo;re wrong. I&rsquo;m not afraid of
my fear. It&rsquo;s folly, the Christian argument that you should live always
in view of your death. The only way to live is to forget that you&rsquo;re
going to die. Death is unimportant. The fear of it should never influence a
single action of the wise man. I know that I shall die struggling for breath,
and I know that I shall be horribly afraid. I know that I shall not be able to
keep myself from regretting bitterly the life that has brought me to such a
pass; but I disown that regret. I now, weak, old, diseased, poor, dying, hold
still my soul in my hands, and I regret nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you remember that Persian carpet you gave me?&rdquo; asked
Philip.
</p>

<p>
Cronshaw smiled his old, slow smile of past days.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I told you that it would give you an answer to your question when you
asked me what was the meaning of life. Well, have you discovered the
answer?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; smiled Philip. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell it me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, I can&rsquo;t do that. The answer is meaningless unless you
discover it for yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>LXXXIII</h2>

<p>
Cronshaw was publishing his poems. His friends had been urging him to do this
for years, but his laziness made it impossible for him to take the necessary
steps. He had always answered their exhortations by telling them that the love
of poetry was dead in England. You brought out a book which had cost you years
of thought and labour; it was given two or three contemptuous lines among a
batch of similar volumes, twenty or thirty copies were sold, and the rest of
the edition was pulped. He had long since worn out the desire for fame. That
was an illusion like all else. But one of his friends had taken the matter into
his own hands. This was a man of letters, named Leonard Upjohn, whom Philip had
met once or twice with Cronshaw in the cafes of the Quarter. He had a
considerable reputation in England as a critic and was the accredited exponent
in this country of modern French literature. He had lived a good deal in France
among the men who made the Mercure de France the liveliest review of the day,
and by the simple process of expressing in English their point of view he had
acquired in England a reputation for originality. Philip had read some of his
articles. He had formed a style for himself by a close imitation of Sir Thomas
Browne; he used elaborate sentences, carefully balanced, and obsolete,
resplendent words: it gave his writing an appearance of individuality. Leonard
Upjohn had induced Cronshaw to give him all his poems and found that there were
enough to make a volume of reasonable size. He promised to use his influence
with publishers. Cronshaw was in want of money. Since his illness he had found
it more difficult than ever to work steadily; he made barely enough to keep
himself in liquor; and when Upjohn wrote to him that this publisher and the
other, though admiring the poems, thought it not worth while to publish them,
Cronshaw began to grow interested. He wrote impressing upon Upjohn his great
need and urging him to make more strenuous efforts. Now that he was going to
die he wanted to leave behind him a published book, and at the back of his mind
was the feeling that he had produced great poetry. He expected to burst upon
the world like a new star. There was something fine in keeping to himself these
treasures of beauty all his life and giving them to the world disdainfully
when, he and the world parting company, he had no further use for them.
</p>

<p>
His decision to come to England was caused directly by an announcement from
Leonard Upjohn that a publisher had consented to print the poems. By a miracle
of persuasion Upjohn had persuaded him to give ten pounds in advance of
royalties.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In advance of royalties, mind you,&rdquo; said Cronshaw to Philip.
&ldquo;Milton only got ten pounds down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Upjohn had promised to write a signed article about them, and he would ask his
friends who reviewed to do their best. Cronshaw pretended to treat the matter
with detachment, but it was easy to see that he was delighted with the thought
of the stir he would make.
</p>

<p>
One day Philip went to dine by arrangement at the wretched eating-house at
which Cronshaw insisted on taking his meals, but Cronshaw did not appear.
Philip learned that he had not been there for three days. He got himself
something to eat and went round to the address from which Cronshaw had first
written to him. He had some difficulty in finding Hyde Street. It was a street
of dingy houses huddled together; many of the windows had been broken and were
clumsily repaired with strips of French newspaper; the doors had not been
painted for years; there were shabby little shops on the ground floor,
laundries, cobblers, stationers. Ragged children played in the road, and an old
barrel-organ was grinding out a vulgar tune. Philip knocked at the door of
Cronshaw&rsquo;s house (there was a shop of cheap sweetstuffs at the bottom),
and it was opened by an elderly Frenchwoman in a dirty apron. Philip asked her
if Cronshaw was in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, yes, there is an Englishman who lives at the top, at the back. I
don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s in. If you want him you had better go up and
see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The staircase was lit by one jet of gas. There was a revolting odour in the
house. When Philip was passing up a woman came out of a room on the first
floor, looked at him suspiciously, but made no remark. There were three doors
on the top landing. Philip knocked at one, and knocked again; there was no
reply; he tried the handle, but the door was locked. He knocked at another
door, got no answer, and tried the door again. It opened. The room was dark.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He recognised Cronshaw&rsquo;s voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Carey. Can I come in?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He received no answer. He walked in. The window was closed and the stink was
overpowering. There was a certain amount of light from the arc-lamp in the
street, and he saw that it was a small room with two beds in it, end to end;
there was a washing-stand and one chair, but they left little space for anyone
to move in. Cronshaw was in the bed nearest the window. He made no movement,
but gave a low chuckle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you light the candle?&rdquo; he said then.
</p>

<p>
Philip struck a match and discovered that there was a candlestick on the floor
beside the bed. He lit it and put it on the washing-stand. Cronshaw was lying
on his back immobile; he looked very odd in his nightshirt; and his baldness
was disconcerting. His face was earthy and death-like.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, old man, you look awfully ill. Is there anyone to look after you
here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;George brings me in a bottle of milk in the morning before he goes to
his work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s George?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I call him George because his name is Adolphe. He shares this palatial
apartment with me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip noticed then that the second bed had not been made since it was slept
in. The pillow was black where the head had rested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you&rsquo;re sharing this room with somebody
else?&rdquo; he cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not? Lodging costs money in Soho. George is a waiter, he goes out at
eight in the morning and does not come in till closing time, so he isn&rsquo;t
in my way at all. We neither of us sleep well, and he helps to pass away the
hours of the night by telling me stories of his life. He&rsquo;s a Swiss, and
I&rsquo;ve always had a taste for waiters. They see life from an entertaining
angle.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How long have you been in bed?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Three days.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you mean to say you&rsquo;ve had nothing but a bottle of milk
for the last three days? Why on earth didn&rsquo;t you send me a line? I
can&rsquo;t bear to think of you lying here all day long without a soul to
attend to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Cronshaw gave a little laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look at your face. Why, dear boy, I really believe you&rsquo;re
distressed. You nice fellow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip blushed. He had not suspected that his face showed the dismay he felt at
the sight of that horrible room and the wretched circumstances of the poor
poet. Cronshaw, watching Philip, went on with a gentle smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been quite happy. Look, here are my proofs. Remember that I
am indifferent to discomforts which would harass other folk. What do the
circumstances of life matter if your dreams make you lord paramount of time and
space?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The proofs were lying on his bed, and as he lay in the darkness he had been
able to place his hands on them. He showed them to Philip and his eyes glowed.
He turned over the pages, rejoicing in the clear type; he read out a stanza.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t look bad, do they?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip had an idea. It would involve him in a little expense and he could not
afford even the smallest increase of expenditure; but on the other hand this
was a case where it revolted him to think of economy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, I can&rsquo;t bear the thought of your remaining here. I&rsquo;ve
got an extra room, it&rsquo;s empty at present, but I can easily get someone to
lend me a bed. Won&rsquo;t you come and live with me for a while? It&rsquo;ll
save you the rent of this.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my dear boy, you&rsquo;d insist on my keeping my window open.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You shall have every window in the place sealed if you like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall be all right tomorrow. I could have got up today, only I felt
lazy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you can very easily make the move. And then if you don&rsquo;t feel
well at any time you can just go to bed, and I shall be there to look after
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If it&rsquo;ll please you I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; said Cronshaw, with
his torpid not unpleasant smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be ripping.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They settled that Philip should fetch Cronshaw next day, and Philip snatched an
hour from his busy morning to arrange the change. He found Cronshaw dressed,
sitting in his hat and great-coat on the bed, with a small, shabby portmanteau,
containing his clothes and books, already packed: it was on the floor by his
feet, and he looked as if he were sitting in the waiting-room of a station.
Philip laughed at the sight of him. They went over to Kennington in a
four-wheeler, of which the windows were carefully closed, and Philip installed
his guest in his own room. He had gone out early in the morning and bought for
himself a second-hand bedstead, a cheap chest of drawers, and a looking-glass.
Cronshaw settled down at once to correct his proofs. He was much better.
</p>

<p>
Philip found him, except for the irritability which was a symptom of his
disease, an easy guest. He had a lecture at nine in the morning, so did not see
Cronshaw till the night. Once or twice Philip persuaded him to share the
scrappy meal he prepared for himself in the evening, but Cronshaw was too
restless to stay in, and preferred generally to get himself something to eat in
one or other of the cheapest restaurants in Soho. Philip asked him to see Dr.
Tyrell, but he stoutly refused; he knew a doctor would tell him to stop
drinking, and this he was resolved not to do. He always felt horribly ill in
the morning, but his absinthe at mid-day put him on his feet again, and by the
time he came home, at midnight, he was able to talk with the brilliancy which
had astonished Philip when first he made his acquaintance. His proofs were
corrected; and the volume was to come out among the publications of the early
spring, when the public might be supposed to have recovered from the avalanche
of Christmas books.

<h2>LXXXIV</h2>

<p>
At the new year Philip became dresser in the surgical out-patients&rsquo;
department. The work was of the same character as that which he had just been
engaged on, but with the greater directness which surgery has than medicine;
and a larger proportion of the patients suffered from those two diseases which
a supine public allows, in its prudishness, to be spread broadcast. The
assistant-surgeon for whom Philip dressed was called Jacobs. He was a short,
fat man, with an exuberant joviality, a bald head, and a loud voice; he had a
cockney accent, and was generally described by the students as an &lsquo;awful
bounder&rsquo;; but his cleverness, both as a surgeon and as a teacher, caused
some of them to overlook this. He had also a considerable facetiousness, which
he exercised impartially on the patients and on the students. He took a great
pleasure in making his dressers look foolish. Since they were ignorant,
nervous, and could not answer as if he were their equal, this was not very
difficult. He enjoyed his afternoons, with the home truths he permitted
himself, much more than the students who had to put up with them with a smile.
One day a case came up of a boy with a club-foot. His parents wanted to know
whether anything could be done. Mr. Jacobs turned to Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better take this case, Carey. It&rsquo;s a subject you ought
to know something about.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip flushed, all the more because the surgeon spoke obviously with a
humorous intention, and his brow-beaten dressers laughed obsequiously. It was
in point of fact a subject which Philip, since coming to the hospital, had
studied with anxious attention. He had read everything in the library which
treated of talipes in its various forms. He made the boy take off his boot and
stocking. He was fourteen, with a snub nose, blue eyes, and a freckled face.
His father explained that they wanted something done if possible, it was such a
hindrance to the kid in earning his living. Philip looked at him curiously. He
was a jolly boy, not at all shy, but talkative and with a cheekiness which his
father reproved. He was much interested in his foot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only for the looks of the thing, you know,&rdquo; he said to
Philip. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t find it no trouble.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Be quiet, Ernie,&rdquo; said his father. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s too much
gas about you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip examined the foot and passed his hand slowly over the shapelessness of
it. He could not understand why the boy felt none of the humiliation which
always oppressed himself. He wondered why he could not take his deformity with
that philosophic indifference. Presently Mr. Jacobs came up to him. The boy was
sitting on the edge of a couch, the surgeon and Philip stood on each side of
him; and in a semi-circle, crowding round, were students. With accustomed
brilliancy Jacobs gave a graphic little discourse upon the club-foot: he spoke
of its varieties and of the forms which followed upon different anatomical
conditions.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ve got talipes equinus?&rdquo; he said, turning
suddenly to Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip felt the eyes of his fellow-students rest on him, and he cursed himself
because he could not help blushing. He felt the sweat start up in the palms of
his hands. The surgeon spoke with the fluency due to long practice and with the
admirable perspicacity which distinguished him. He was tremendously interested
in his profession. But Philip did not listen. He was only wishing that the
fellow would get done quickly. Suddenly he realised that Jacobs was addressing
him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind taking off your sock for a moment, Carey?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip felt a shudder pass through him. He had an impulse to tell the surgeon
to go to hell, but he had not the courage to make a scene. He feared his brutal
ridicule. He forced himself to appear indifferent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
He sat down and unlaced his boot. His fingers were trembling and he thought he
should never untie the knot. He remembered how they had forced him at school to
show his foot, and the misery which had eaten into his soul.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He keeps his feet nice and clean, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; said Jacobs,
in his rasping, cockney voice.
</p>

<p>
The attendant students giggled. Philip noticed that the boy whom they were
examining looked down at his foot with eager curiosity. Jacobs took the foot in
his hands and said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s what I thought. I see you&rsquo;ve had an operation.
When you were a child, I suppose?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He went on with his fluent explanations. The students leaned over and looked at
the foot. Two or three examined it minutely when Jacobs let it go.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When you&rsquo;ve quite done,&rdquo; said Philip, with a smile,
ironically.
</p>

<p>
He could have killed them all. He thought how jolly it would be to jab a chisel
(he didn&rsquo;t know why that particular instrument came into his mind) into
their necks. What beasts men were! He wished he could believe in hell so as to
comfort himself with the thought of the horrible tortures which would be
theirs. Mr. Jacobs turned his attention to treatment. He talked partly to the
boy&rsquo;s father and partly to the students. Philip put on his sock and laced
his boot. At last the surgeon finished. But he seemed to have an afterthought
and turned to Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know, I think it might be worth your while to have an operation. Of
course I couldn&rsquo;t give you a normal foot, but I think I can do something.
You might think about it, and when you want a holiday you can just come into
the hospital for a bit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip had often asked himself whether anything could be done, but his distaste
for any reference to the subject had prevented him from consulting any of the
surgeons at the hospital. His reading told him that whatever might have been
done when he was a small boy, and then treatment of talipes was not as skilful
as in the present day, there was small chance now of any great benefit. Still
it would be worth while if an operation made it possible for him to wear a more
ordinary boot and to limp less. He remembered how passionately he had prayed
for the miracle which his uncle had assured him was possible to omnipotence. He
smiled ruefully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was rather a simple soul in those days,&rdquo; he thought.
</p>

<p>
Towards the end of February it was clear that Cronshaw was growing much worse.
He was no longer able to get up. He lay in bed, insisting that the window
should be closed always, and refused to see a doctor; he would take little
nourishment, but demanded whiskey and cigarettes: Philip knew that he should
have neither, but Cronshaw&rsquo;s argument was unanswerable.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I daresay they are killing me. I don&rsquo;t care. You&rsquo;ve warned
me, you&rsquo;ve done all that was necessary: I ignore your warning. Give me
something to drink and be damned to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Leonard Upjohn blew in two or three times a week, and there was something of
the dead leaf in his appearance which made the word exactly descriptive of the
manner of his appearance. He was a weedy-looking fellow of five-and-thirty,
with long pale hair and a white face; he had the look of a man who lived too
little in the open air. He wore a hat like a dissenting minister&rsquo;s.
Philip disliked him for his patronising manner and was bored by his fluent
conversation. Leonard Upjohn liked to hear himself talk. He was not sensitive
to the interest of his listeners, which is the first requisite of the good
talker; and he never realised that he was telling people what they knew
already. With measured words he told Philip what to think of Rodin, Albert
Samain, and Caesar Franck. Philip&rsquo;s charwoman only came in for an hour in
the morning, and since Philip was obliged to be at the hospital all day
Cronshaw was left much alone. Upjohn told Philip that he thought someone should
remain with him, but did not offer to make it possible.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dreadful to think of that great poet alone. Why, he might die
without a soul at hand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think he very probably will,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can you be so callous!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come and do your work here every day, and then
you&rsquo;d be near if he wanted anything?&rdquo; asked Philip drily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I? My dear fellow, I can only work in the surroundings I&rsquo;m used
to, and besides I go out so much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Upjohn was also a little put out because Philip had brought Cronshaw to his own
rooms.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish you had left him in Soho,&rdquo; he said, with a wave of his
long, thin hands. &ldquo;There was a touch of romance in that sordid attic. I
could even bear it if it were Wapping or Shoreditch, but the respectability of
Kennington! What a place for a poet to die!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Cronshaw was often so ill-humoured that Philip could only keep his temper by
remembering all the time that this irritability was a symptom of the disease.
Upjohn came sometimes before Philip was in, and then Cronshaw would complain of
him bitterly. Upjohn listened with complacency.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The fact is that Carey has no sense of beauty,&rdquo; he smiled.
&ldquo;He has a middle-class mind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was very sarcastic to Philip, and Philip exercised a good deal of
self-control in his dealings with him. But one evening he could not contain
himself. He had had a hard day at the hospital and was tired out. Leonard
Upjohn came to him, while he was making himself a cup of tea in the kitchen,
and said that Cronshaw was complaining of Philip&rsquo;s insistence that he
should have a doctor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you realise that you&rsquo;re enjoying a very rare, a very
exquisite privilege? You ought to do everything in your power, surely, to show
your sense of the greatness of your trust.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rare and exquisite privilege which I can ill afford,&rdquo;
said Philip.
</p>

<p>
Whenever there was any question of money, Leonard Upjohn assumed a slightly
disdainful expression. His sensitive temperament was offended by the reference.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something fine in Cronshaw&rsquo;s attitude, and you
disturb it by your importunity. You should make allowances for the delicate
imaginings which you cannot feel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip&rsquo;s face darkened.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let us go in to Cronshaw,&rdquo; he said frigidly.
</p>

<p>
The poet was lying on his back, reading a book, with a pipe in his mouth. The
air was musty; and the room, notwithstanding Philip&rsquo;s tidying up, had the
bedraggled look which seemed to accompany Cronshaw wherever he went. He took
off his spectacles as they came in. Philip was in a towering rage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Upjohn tells me you&rsquo;ve been complaining to him because I&rsquo;ve
urged you to have a doctor,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want you to have a doctor,
because you may die any day, and if you hadn&rsquo;t been seen by anyone I
shouldn&rsquo;t be able to get a certificate. There&rsquo;d have to be an
inquest and I should be blamed for not calling a doctor in.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that. I thought you wanted me to see a doctor
for my sake and not for your own. I&rsquo;ll see a doctor whenever you
like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip did not answer, but gave an almost imperceptible shrug of the shoulders.
Cronshaw, watching him, gave a little chuckle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so angry, my dear. I know very well you want to do
everything you can for me. Let&rsquo;s see your doctor, perhaps he can do
something for me, and at any rate it&rsquo;ll comfort you.&rdquo; He turned his
eyes to Upjohn. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a damned fool, Leonard. Why d&rsquo;you
want to worry the boy? He has quite enough to do to put up with me.
You&rsquo;ll do nothing more for me than write a pretty article about me after
my death. I know you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Next day Philip went to Dr. Tyrell. He felt that he was the sort of man to be
interested by the story, and as soon as Tyrell was free of his day&rsquo;s work
he accompanied Philip to Kennington. He could only agree with what Philip had
told him. The case was hopeless.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take him into the hospital if you like,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;He can have a small ward.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing would induce him to come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know, he may die any minute, or else he may get another attack of
pneumonia.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip nodded. Dr. Tyrell made one or two suggestions, and promised to come
again whenever Philip wanted him to. He left his address. When Philip went back
to Cronshaw he found him quietly reading. He did not trouble to inquire what
the doctor had said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you satisfied now, dear boy?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose nothing will induce you to do any of the things Tyrell
advised?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; smiled Cronshaw.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>LXXXV</h2>

<p>
About a fortnight after this Philip, going home one evening after his
day&rsquo;s work at the hospital, knocked at the door of Cronshaw&rsquo;s room.
He got no answer and walked in. Cronshaw was lying huddled up on one side, and
Philip went up to the bed. He did not know whether Cronshaw was asleep or
merely lay there in one of his uncontrollable fits of irritability. He was
surprised to see that his mouth was open. He touched his shoulder. Philip gave
a cry of dismay. He slipped his hand under Cronshaw&rsquo;s shirt and felt his
heart; he did not know what to do; helplessly, because he had heard of this
being done, he held a looking-glass in front of his mouth. It startled him to
be alone with Cronshaw. He had his hat and coat still on, and he ran down the
stairs into the street; he hailed a cab and drove to Harley Street. Dr. Tyrell
was in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, would you mind coming at once? I think Cronshaw&rsquo;s
dead.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If he is it&rsquo;s not much good my coming, is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should be awfully grateful if you would. I&rsquo;ve got a cab at the
door. It&rsquo;ll only take half an hour.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Tyrell put on his hat. In the cab he asked him one or two questions.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He seemed no worse than usual when I left this morning,&rdquo; said
Philip. &ldquo;It gave me an awful shock when I went in just now. And the
thought of his dying all alone…. D&rsquo;you think he knew he was going to
die?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip remembered what Cronshaw had said. He wondered whether at that last
moment he had been seized with the terror of death. Philip imagined himself in
such a plight, knowing it was inevitable and with no one, not a soul, to give
an encouraging word when the fear seized him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re rather upset,&rdquo; said Dr. Tyrell.
</p>

<p>
He looked at him with his bright blue eyes. They were not unsympathetic. When
he saw Cronshaw, he said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He must have been dead for some hours. I should think he died in his
sleep. They do sometimes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The body looked shrunk and ignoble. It was not like anything human. Dr. Tyrell
looked at it dispassionately. With a mechanical gesture he took out his watch.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I must be getting along. I&rsquo;ll send the certificate round. I
suppose you&rsquo;ll communicate with the relatives.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there are any,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How about the funeral?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll see to that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dr. Tyrell gave Philip a glance. He wondered whether he ought to offer a couple
of sovereigns towards it. He knew nothing of Philip&rsquo;s circumstances;
perhaps he could well afford the expense; Philip might think it impertinent if
he made any suggestion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, let me know if there&rsquo;s anything I can do,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
Philip and he went out together, parting on the doorstep, and Philip went to a
telegraph office in order to send a message to Leonard Upjohn. Then he went to
an undertaker whose shop he passed every day on his way to the hospital. His
attention had been drawn to it often by the three words in silver lettering on
a black cloth, which, with two model coffins, adorned the window: Economy,
Celerity, Propriety. They had always diverted him. The undertaker was a little
fat Jew with curly black hair, long and greasy, in black, with a large diamond
ring on a podgy finger. He received Philip with a peculiar manner formed by the
mingling of his natural blatancy with the subdued air proper to his calling. He
quickly saw that Philip was very helpless and promised to send round a woman at
once to perform the needful offices. His suggestions for the funeral were very
magnificent; and Philip felt ashamed of himself when the undertaker seemed to
think his objections mean. It was horrible to haggle on such a matter, and
finally Philip consented to an expensiveness which he could ill afford.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I quite understand, sir,&rdquo; said the undertaker, &ldquo;you
don&rsquo;t want any show and that&mdash;I&rsquo;m not a believer in
ostentation myself, mind you&mdash;but you want it done gentlemanly-like. You
leave it to me, I&rsquo;ll do it as cheap as it can be done, &rsquo;aving
regard to what&rsquo;s right and proper. I can&rsquo;t say more than that, can
I?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip went home to eat his supper, and while he ate the woman came along to
lay out the corpse. Presently a telegram arrived from Leonard Upjohn.
</p>

<p>
Shocked and grieved beyond measure. Regret cannot come tonight. Dining out.
With you early tomorrow. Deepest sympathy. Upjohn.
</p>

<p>
In a little while the woman knocked at the door of the sitting-room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done now, sir. Will you come and look at &rsquo;im and see
it&rsquo;s all right?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip followed her. Cronshaw was lying on his back, with his eyes closed and
his hands folded piously across his chest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You ought by rights to &rsquo;ave a few flowers, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get some tomorrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She gave the body a glance of satisfaction. She had performed her job, and now
she rolled down her sleeves, took off her apron, and put on her bonnet. Philip
asked her how much he owed her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, sir, some give me two and sixpence and some give me five
shillings.&rdquo;

<p>
Philip was ashamed to give her less than the larger sum. She thanked him with
just so much effusiveness as was seemly in presence of the grief he might be
supposed to feel, and left him. Philip went back into his sitting-room, cleared
away the remains of his supper, and sat down to read Walsham&rsquo;s Surgery.
He found it difficult. He felt singularly nervous. When there was a sound on
the stairs he jumped, and his heart beat violently. That thing in the adjoining
room, which had been a man and now was nothing, frightened him. The silence
seemed alive, as if some mysterious movement were taking place within it; the
presence of death weighed upon these rooms, unearthly and terrifying: Philip
felt a sudden horror for what had once been his friend. He tried to force
himself to read, but presently pushed away his book in despair. What troubled
him was the absolute futility of the life which had just ended. It did not
matter if Cronshaw was alive or dead. It would have been just as well if he had
never lived. Philip thought of Cronshaw young; and it needed an effort of
imagination to picture him slender, with a springing step, and with hair on his
head, buoyant and hopeful. Philip&rsquo;s rule of life, to follow one&rsquo;s
instincts with due regard to the policeman round the corner, had not acted very
well there: it was because Cronshaw had done this that he had made such a
lamentable failure of existence. It seemed that the instincts could not be
trusted. Philip was puzzled, and he asked himself what rule of life was there,
if that one was useless, and why people acted in one way rather than in
another. They acted according to their emotions, but their emotions might be
good or bad; it seemed just a chance whether they led to triumph or disaster.
Life seemed an inextricable confusion. Men hurried hither and thither, urged by
forces they knew not; and the purpose of it all escaped them; they seemed to
hurry just for hurrying&rsquo;s sake.
</p>

<p>
Next morning Leonard Upjohn appeared with a small wreath of laurel. He was
pleased with his idea of crowning the dead poet with this; and attempted,
notwithstanding Philip&rsquo;s disapproving silence, to fix it on the bald
head; but the wreath fitted grotesquely. It looked like the brim of a hat worn
by a low comedian in a music-hall.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put it over his heart instead,&rdquo; said Upjohn.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve put it on his stomach,&rdquo; remarked Philip.
</p>

<p>
Upjohn gave a thin smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only a poet knows where lies a poet&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
They went back into the sitting-room, and Philip told him what arrangements he
had made for the funeral.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hoped you&rsquo;ve spared no expense. I should like the hearse to be
followed by a long string of empty coaches, and I should like the horses to
wear tall nodding plumes, and there should be a vast number of mutes with long
streamers on their hats. I like the thought of all those empty coaches.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As the cost of the funeral will apparently fall on me and I&rsquo;m not
over flush just now, I&rsquo;ve tried to make it as moderate as
possible.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, my dear fellow, in that case, why didn&rsquo;t you get him a
pauper&rsquo;s funeral? There would have been something poetic in that. You
have an unerring instinct for mediocrity.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip flushed a little, but did not answer; and next day he and Upjohn
followed the hearse in the one carriage which Philip had ordered. Lawson,
unable to come, had sent a wreath; and Philip, so that the coffin should not
seem too neglected, had bought a couple. On the way back the coachman whipped
up his horses. Philip was dog-tired and presently went to sleep. He was
awakened by Upjohn&rsquo;s voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather lucky the poems haven&rsquo;t come out yet. I think
we&rsquo;d better hold them back a bit and I&rsquo;ll write a preface. I began
thinking of it during the drive to the cemetery. I believe I can do something
rather good. Anyhow I&rsquo;ll start with an article in The Saturday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip did not reply, and there was silence between them. At last Upjohn said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I daresay I&rsquo;d be wiser not to whittle away my copy. I think
I&rsquo;ll do an article for one of the reviews, and then I can just print it
afterwards as a preface.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip kept his eye on the monthlies, and a few weeks later it appeared. The
article made something of a stir, and extracts from it were printed in many of
the papers. It was a very good article, vaguely biographical, for no one knew
much of Cronshaw&rsquo;s early life, but delicate, tender, and picturesque.
Leonard Upjohn in his intricate style drew graceful little pictures of Cronshaw
in the Latin Quarter, talking, writing poetry: Cronshaw became a picturesque
figure, an English Verlaine; and Leonard Upjohn&rsquo;s coloured phrases took
on a tremulous dignity, a more pathetic grandiloquence, as he described the
sordid end, the shabby little room in Soho; and, with a reticence which was
wholly charming and suggested a much greater generosity than modesty allowed
him to state, the efforts he made to transport the Poet to some cottage
embowered with honeysuckle amid a flowering orchard. And the lack of sympathy,
well-meaning but so tactless, which had taken the poet instead to the vulgar
respectability of Kennington! Leonard Upjohn described Kennington with that
restrained humour which a strict adherence to the vocabulary of Sir Thomas
Browne necessitated. With delicate sarcasm he narrated the last weeks, the
patience with which Cronshaw bore the well-meaning clumsiness of the young
student who had appointed himself his nurse, and the pitifulness of that divine
vagabond in those hopelessly middle-class surroundings. Beauty from ashes, he
quoted from Isaiah. It was a triumph of irony for that outcast poet to die amid
the trappings of vulgar respectability; it reminded Leonard Upjohn of Christ
among the Pharisees, and the analogy gave him opportunity for an exquisite
passage. And then he told how a friend&mdash;his good taste did not suffer him
more than to hint subtly who the friend was with such gracious
fancies&mdash;had laid a laurel wreath on the dead poet&rsquo;s heart; and the
beautiful dead hands had seemed to rest with a voluptuous passion upon
Apollo&rsquo;s leaves, fragrant with the fragrance of art, and more green than
jade brought by swart mariners from the manifold, inexplicable China. And, an
admirable contrast, the article ended with a description of the middle-class,
ordinary, prosaic funeral of him who should have been buried like a prince or
like a pauper. It was the crowning buffet, the final victory of Philistia over
art, beauty, and immaterial things.
</p>

<p>
Leonard Upjohn had never written anything better. It was a miracle of charm,
grace, and pity. He printed all Cronshaw&rsquo;s best poems in the course of
the article, so that when the volume appeared much of its point was gone; but
he advanced his own position a good deal. He was thenceforth a critic to be
reckoned with. He had seemed before a little aloof; but there was a warm
humanity about this article which was infinitely attractive.

<h2>LXXXVI</h2>

<p>
In the spring Philip, having finished his dressing in the out-patients&rsquo;
department, became an in-patients&rsquo; clerk. This appointment lasted six
months. The clerk spent every morning in the wards, first in the men&rsquo;s,
then in the women&rsquo;s, with the house-physician; he wrote up cases, made
tests, and passed the time of day with the nurses. On two afternoons a week the
physician in charge went round with a little knot of students, examined the
cases, and dispensed information. The work had not the excitement, the constant
change, the intimate contact with reality, of the work in the
out-patients&rsquo; department; but Philip picked up a good deal of knowledge.
He got on very well with the patients, and he was a little flattered at the
pleasure they showed in his attendance on them. He was not conscious of any
deep sympathy in their sufferings, but he liked them; and because he put on no
airs he was more popular with them than others of the clerks. He was pleasant,
encouraging, and friendly. Like everyone connected with hospitals he found that
male patients were more easy to get on with than female. The women were often
querulous and ill-tempered. They complained bitterly of the hard-worked nurses,
who did not show them the attention they thought their right; and they were
troublesome, ungrateful, and rude.
</p>

<p>
Presently Philip was fortunate enough to make a friend. One morning the
house-physician gave him a new case, a man; and, seating himself at the
bedside, Philip proceeded to write down particulars on the
&lsquo;letter.&rsquo; He noticed on looking at this that the patient was
described as a journalist: his name was Thorpe Athelny, an unusual one for a
hospital patient, and his age was forty-eight. He was suffering from a sharp
attack of jaundice, and had been taken into the ward on account of obscure
symptoms which it seemed necessary to watch. He answered the various questions
which it was Philip&rsquo;s duty to ask him in a pleasant, educated voice.
Since he was lying in bed it was difficult to tell if he was short or tall, but
his small head and small hands suggested that he was a man of less than average
height. Philip had the habit of looking at people&rsquo;s hands, and
Athelny&rsquo;s astonished him: they were very small, with long, tapering
fingers and beautiful, rosy finger-nails; they were very smooth and except for
the jaundice would have been of a surprising whiteness. The patient kept them
outside the bed-clothes, one of them slightly spread out, the second and third
fingers together, and, while he spoke to Philip, seemed to contemplate them
with satisfaction. With a twinkle in his eyes Philip glanced at the man&rsquo;s
face. Notwithstanding the yellowness it was distinguished; he had blue eyes, a
nose of an imposing boldness, hooked, aggressive but not clumsy, and a small
beard, pointed and gray: he was rather bald, but his hair had evidently been
quite fine, curling prettily, and he still wore it long.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see you&rsquo;re a journalist,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;What papers
d&rsquo;you write for?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I write for all the papers. You cannot open a paper without seeing some
of my writing.&rdquo; There was one by the side of the bed and reaching for it
he pointed out an advertisement. In large letters was the name of a firm
well-known to Philip, Lynn and Sedley, Regent Street, London; and below, in
type smaller but still of some magnitude, was the dogmatic statement:
Procrastination is the Thief of Time. Then a question, startling because of its
reasonableness: Why not order today? There was a repetition, in large letters,
like the hammering of conscience on a murderer&rsquo;s heart: Why not? Then,
boldly: Thousands of pairs of gloves from the leading markets of the world at
astounding prices. Thousands of pairs of stockings from the most reliable
manufacturers of the universe at sensational reductions. Finally the question
recurred, but flung now like a challenging gauntlet in the lists: Why not order
today?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the press representative of Lynn and Sedley.&rdquo; He gave a
little wave of his beautiful hand. &ldquo;To what base uses…&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip went on asking the regulation questions, some a mere matter of routine,
others artfully devised to lead the patient to discover things which he might
be expected to desire to conceal.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you ever lived abroad?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was in Spain for eleven years.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What were you doing there?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was secretary of the English water company at Toledo.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip remembered that Clutton had spent some months in Toledo, and the
journalist&rsquo;s answer made him look at him with more interest; but he felt
it would be improper to show this: it was necessary to preserve the distance
between the hospital patient and the staff. When he had finished his
examination he went on to other beds.
</p>

<p>
Thorpe Athelny&rsquo;s illness was not grave, and, though remaining very
yellow, he soon felt much better: he stayed in bed only because the physician
thought he should be kept under observation till certain reactions became
normal. One day, on entering the ward, Philip noticed that Athelny, pencil in
hand, was reading a book. He put it down when Philip came to his bed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;May I see what you&rsquo;re reading?&rdquo; asked Philip, who could
never pass a book without looking at it.
</p>

<p>
Philip took it up and saw that it was a volume of Spanish verse, the poems of
San Juan de la Cruz, and as he opened it a sheet of paper fell out. Philip
picked it up and noticed that verse was written upon it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to tell me you&rsquo;ve been occupying your
leisure in writing poetry? That&rsquo;s a most improper proceeding in a
hospital patient.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was trying to do some translations. D&rsquo;you know Spanish?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you know all about San Juan de la Cruz, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t indeed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He was one of the Spanish mystics. He&rsquo;s one of the best poets
they&rsquo;ve ever had. I thought it would be worth while translating him into
English.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;May I look at your translation?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very rough,&rdquo; said Athelny, but he gave it to Philip
with an alacrity which suggested that he was eager for him to read it.
</p>

<p>
It was written in pencil, in a fine but very peculiar handwriting, which was
hard to read: it was just like black letter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it take you an awful time to write like that? It&rsquo;s
wonderful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why handwriting shouldn&rsquo;t be beautiful.&rdquo;
Philip read the first verse:
</p>

<p>
             In an obscure night<br/>
             With anxious love inflamed<br/>
             O happy lot!<br/>
             Forth unobserved I went,<br/>
             My house being now at rest…
</p>

<p>
Philip looked curiously at Thorpe Athelny. He did not know whether he felt a
little shy with him or was attracted by him. He was conscious that his manner
had been slightly patronising, and he flushed as it struck him that Athelny
might have thought him ridiculous.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What an unusual name you&rsquo;ve got,&rdquo; he remarked, for something
to say.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very old Yorkshire name. Once it took the head of my family
a day&rsquo;s hard riding to make the circuit of his estates, but the mighty
are fallen. Fast women and slow horses.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was short-sighted and when he spoke looked at you with a peculiar intensity.
He took up his volume of poetry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You should read Spanish,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is a noble tongue. It
has not the mellifluousness of Italian, Italian is the language of tenors and
organ-grinders, but it has grandeur: it does not ripple like a brook in a
garden, but it surges tumultuous like a mighty river in flood.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His grandiloquence amused Philip, but he was sensitive to rhetoric; and he
listened with pleasure while Athelny, with picturesque expressions and the fire
of a real enthusiasm, described to him the rich delight of reading Don Quixote
in the original and the music, romantic, limpid, passionate, of the enchanting
Calderon.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must get on with my work,&rdquo; said Philip presently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, forgive me, I forgot. I will tell my wife to bring me a photograph
of Toledo, and I will show it you. Come and talk to me when you have the
chance. You don&rsquo;t know what a pleasure it gives me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
During the next few days, in moments snatched whenever there was opportunity,
Philip&rsquo;s acquaintance with the journalist increased. Thorpe Athelny was a
good talker. He did not say brilliant things, but he talked inspiringly, with
an eager vividness which fired the imagination; Philip, living so much in a
world of make-believe, found his fancy teeming with new pictures. Athelny had
very good manners. He knew much more than Philip, both of the world and of
books; he was a much older man; and the readiness of his conversation gave him
a certain superiority; but he was in the hospital a recipient of charity,
subject to strict rules; and he held himself between the two positions with
ease and humour. Once Philip asked him why he had come to the hospital.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my principle is to profit by all the benefits that society provides.
I take advantage of the age I live in. When I&rsquo;m ill I get myself patched
up in a hospital and I have no false shame, and I send my children to be
educated at the board-school.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you really?&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And a capital education they get too, much better than I got at
Winchester. How else do you think I could educate them at all? I&rsquo;ve got
nine. You must come and see them all when I get home again. Will you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to very much,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">

<h2>LXXXVII</h2>

<p>
Ten days later Thorpe Athelny was well enough to leave the hospital. He gave
Philip his address, and Philip promised to dine with him at one o&rsquo;clock
on the following Sunday. Athelny had told him that he lived in a house built by
Inigo Jones; he had raved, as he raved over everything, over the balustrade of
old oak; and when he came down to open the door for Philip he made him at once
admire the elegant carving of the lintel. It was a shabby house, badly needing
a coat of paint, but with the dignity of its period, in a little street between
Chancery Lane and Holborn, which had once been fashionable but was now little
better than a slum: there was a plan to pull it down in order to put up
handsome offices; meanwhile the rents were small, and Athelny was able to get
the two upper floors at a price which suited his income. Philip had not seen
him up before and was surprised at his small size; he was not more than five
feet and five inches high. He was dressed fantastically in blue linen trousers
of the sort worn by working men in France, and a very old brown velvet coat; he
wore a bright red sash round his waist, a low collar, and for tie a flowing bow
of the kind used by the comic Frenchman in the pages of Punch. He greeted
Philip with enthusiasm. He began talking at once of the house and passed his
hand lovingly over the balusters.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look at it, feel it, it&rsquo;s like silk. What a miracle of grace! And
in five years the house-breaker will sell it for firewood.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He insisted on taking Philip into a room on the first floor, where a man in
shirt sleeves, a blousy woman, and three children were having their Sunday
dinner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just brought this gentleman in to show him your ceiling. Did
you ever see anything so wonderful? How are you, Mrs. Hodgson? This is Mr.
Carey, who looked after me when I was in the hospital.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come in, sir,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Any friend of Mr.
Athelny&rsquo;s is welcome. Mr. Athelny shows the ceiling to all his friends.
And it don&rsquo;t matter what we&rsquo;re doing, if we&rsquo;re in bed or if
I&rsquo;m &rsquo;aving a wash, in &rsquo;e comes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip could see that they looked upon Athelny as a little queer; but they
liked him none the less and they listened open-mouthed while he discoursed with
his impetuous fluency on the beauty of the seventeenth-century ceiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a crime to pull this down, eh, Hodgson? You&rsquo;re an influential
citizen, why don&rsquo;t you write to the papers and protest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man in shirt sleeves gave a laugh and said to Philip:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Athelny will &rsquo;ave his little joke. They do say these
&rsquo;ouses are that insanitory, it&rsquo;s not safe to live in them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sanitation be damned, give me art,&rdquo; cried Athelny.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got nine children and they thrive on bad drains. No, no,
I&rsquo;m not going to take any risk. None of your new-fangled notions for me!
When I move from here I&rsquo;m going to make sure the drains are bad before I
take anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a knock at the door, and a little fair-haired girl opened it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Daddy, mummy says, do stop talking and come and eat your dinner.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is my third daughter,&rdquo; said Athelny, pointing to her with a
dramatic forefinger. &ldquo;She is called Maria del Pilar, but she answers more
willingly to the name of Jane. Jane, your nose wants blowing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got a hanky, daddy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tut, tut, child,&rdquo; he answered, as he produced a vast, brilliant
bandanna, &ldquo;what do you suppose the Almighty gave you fingers for?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They went upstairs, and Philip was taken into a room with walls panelled in
dark oak. In the middle was a narrow table of teak on trestle legs, with two
supporting bars of iron, of the kind called in Spain mesa de hieraje. They were
to dine there, for two places were laid, and there were two large arm-chairs,
with broad flat arms of oak and leathern backs, and leathern seats. They were
severe, elegant, and uncomfortable. The only other piece of furniture was a
bargueno, elaborately ornamented with gilt iron-work, on a stand of
ecclesiastical design roughly but very finely carved. There stood on this two
or three lustre plates, much broken but rich in colour; and on the walls were
old masters of the Spanish school in beautiful though dilapidated frames:
though gruesome in subject, ruined by age and bad treatment, and second-rate in
their conception, they had a glow of passion. There was nothing in the room of
any value, but the effect was lovely. It was magnificent and yet austere.
Philip felt that it offered the very spirit of old Spain. Athelny was in the
middle of showing him the inside of the bargueno, with its beautiful
ornamentation and secret drawers, when a tall girl, with two plaits of bright
brown hair hanging down her back, came in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mother says dinner&rsquo;s ready and waiting and I&rsquo;m to bring it
in as soon as you sit down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come and shake hands with Mr. Carey, Sally.&rdquo; He turned to Philip.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she enormous? She&rsquo;s my eldest. How old are you,
Sally?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fifteen, father, come next June.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I christened her Maria del Sol, because she was my first child and I
dedicated her to the glorious sun of Castile; but her mother calls her Sally
and her brother Pudding-Face.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The girl smiled shyly, she had even, white teeth, and blushed. She was well
set-up, tall for her age, with pleasant gray eyes and a broad forehead. She had
red cheeks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go and tell your mother to come in and shake hands with Mr. Carey before
he sits down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mother says she&rsquo;ll come in after dinner. She hasn&rsquo;t washed
herself yet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll go in and see her ourselves. He mustn&rsquo;t eat the
Yorkshire pudding till he&rsquo;s shaken the hand that made it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip followed his host into the kitchen. It was small and much overcrowded.
There had been a lot of noise, but it stopped as soon as the stranger entered.
There was a large table in the middle and round it, eager for dinner, were
seated Athelny&rsquo;s children. A woman was standing at the oven, taking out
baked potatoes one by one.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Mr. Carey, Betty,&rdquo; said Athelny.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fancy bringing him in here. What will he think?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She wore a dirty apron, and the sleeves of her cotton dress were turned up
above her elbows; she had curling pins in her hair. Mrs. Athelny was a large
woman, a good three inches taller than her husband, fair, with blue eyes and a
kindly expression; she had been a handsome creature, but advancing years and
the bearing of many children had made her fat and blousy; her blue eyes had
become pale, her skin was coarse and red, the colour had gone out of her hair.
She straightened herself, wiped her hand on her apron, and held it out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome, sir,&rdquo; she said, in a slow voice, with an
accent that seemed oddly familiar to Philip. &ldquo;Athelny said you was very
kind to him in the &rsquo;orspital.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now you must be introduced to the live stock,&rdquo; said Athelny.
&ldquo;That is Thorpe,&rdquo; he pointed to a chubby boy with curly hair,
&ldquo;he is my eldest son, heir to the title, estates, and responsibilities of
the family. There is Athelstan, Harold, Edward.&rdquo; He pointed with his
forefinger to three smaller boys, all rosy, healthy, and smiling, though when
they felt Philip&rsquo;s smiling eyes upon them they looked shyly down at their
plates. &ldquo;Now the girls in order: Maria del Sol…&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pudding-Face,&rdquo; said one of the small boys.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your sense of humour is rudimentary, my son. Maria de los Mercedes,
Maria del Pilar, Maria de la Concepcion, Maria del Rosario.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I call them Sally, Molly, Connie, Rosie, and Jane,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Athelny. &ldquo;Now, Athelny, you go into your own room and I&rsquo;ll send you
your dinner. I&rsquo;ll let the children come in afterwards for a bit when
I&rsquo;ve washed them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear, if I&rsquo;d had the naming of you I should have called you
Maria of the Soapsuds. You&rsquo;re always torturing these wretched brats with
soap.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You go first, Mr. Carey, or I shall never get him to sit down and eat
his dinner.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Athelny and Philip installed themselves in the great monkish chairs, and Sally
brought them in two plates of beef, Yorkshire pudding, baked potatoes, and
cabbage. Athelny took sixpence out of his pocket and sent her for a jug of
beer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope you didn&rsquo;t have the table laid here on my account,&rdquo;
said Philip. &ldquo;I should have been quite happy to eat with the
children.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, I always have my meals by myself. I like these antique customs. I
don&rsquo;t think that women ought to sit down at table with men. It ruins
conversation and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s very bad for them. It puts ideas in
their heads, and women are never at ease with themselves when they have
ideas.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Both host and guest ate with a hearty appetite.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you ever taste such Yorkshire pudding? No one can make it like my
wife. That&rsquo;s the advantage of not marrying a lady. You noticed she
wasn&rsquo;t a lady, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was an awkward question, and Philip did not know how to answer it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never thought about it,&rdquo; he said lamely.
</p>

<p>
Athelny laughed. He had a peculiarly joyous laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s not a lady, nor anything like it. Her father was a
farmer, and she&rsquo;s never bothered about aitches in her life. We&rsquo;ve
had twelve children and nine of them are alive. I tell her it&rsquo;s about
time she stopped, but she&rsquo;s an obstinate woman, she&rsquo;s got into the
habit of it now, and I don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;ll be satisfied till
she&rsquo;s had twenty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At that moment Sally came in with the beer, and, having poured out a glass for
Philip, went to the other side of the table to pour some out for her father. He
put his hand round her waist.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you ever see such a handsome, strapping girl? Only fifteen and she
might be twenty. Look at her cheeks. She&rsquo;s never had a day&rsquo;s
illness in her life. It&rsquo;ll be a lucky man who marries her, won&rsquo;t
it, Sally?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sally listened to all this with a slight, slow smile, not much embarrassed, for
she was accustomed to her father&rsquo;s outbursts, but with an easy modesty
which was very attractive.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let your dinner get cold, father,&rdquo; she said, drawing
herself away from his arm. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll call when you&rsquo;re ready for
your pudding, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They were left alone, and Athelny lifted the pewter tankard to his lips. He
drank long and deep.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My word, is there anything better than English beer?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Let us thank God for simple pleasures, roast beef and rice pudding, a
good appetite and beer. I was married to a lady once. My God! Don&rsquo;t marry
a lady, my boy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip laughed. He was exhilarated by the scene, the funny little man in his
odd clothes, the panelled room and the Spanish furniture, the English fare: the
whole thing had an exquisite incongruity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You laugh, my boy, you can&rsquo;t imagine marrying beneath you. You
want a wife who&rsquo;s an intellectual equal. Your head is crammed full of
ideas of comradeship. Stuff and nonsense, my boy! A man doesn&rsquo;t want to
talk politics to his wife, and what do you think I care for Betty&rsquo;s views
upon the Differential Calculus? A man wants a wife who can cook his dinner and
look after his children. I&rsquo;ve tried both and I know. Let&rsquo;s have the
pudding in.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He clapped his hands and presently Sally came. When she took away the plates,
Philip wanted to get up and help her, but Athelny stopped him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let her alone, my boy. She doesn&rsquo;t want you to fuss about, do you,
Sally? And she won&rsquo;t think it rude of you to sit still while she waits
upon you. She don&rsquo;t care a damn for chivalry, do you, Sally?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, father,&rdquo; answered Sally demurely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know what I&rsquo;m talking about, Sally?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, father. But you know mother doesn&rsquo;t like you to swear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Athelny laughed boisterously. Sally brought them plates of rice pudding, rich,
creamy, and luscious. Athelny attacked his with gusto.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One of the rules of this house is that Sunday dinner should never alter.
It is a ritual. Roast beef and rice pudding for fifty Sundays in the year. On
Easter Sunday lamb and green peas, and at Michaelmas roast goose and apple
sauce. Thus we preserve the traditions of our people. When Sally marries she
will forget many of the wise things I have taught her, but she will never
forget that if you want to be good and happy you must eat on Sundays roast beef
and rice pudding.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll call when you&rsquo;re ready for cheese,&rdquo; said Sally
impassively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you know the legend of the halcyon?&rdquo; said Athelny: Philip
was growing used to his rapid leaping from one subject to another. &ldquo;When
the kingfisher, flying over the sea, is exhausted, his mate places herself
beneath him and bears him along upon her stronger wings. That is what a man
wants in a wife, the halcyon. I lived with my first wife for three years. She
was a lady, she had fifteen hundred a year, and we used to give nice little
dinner parties in our little red brick house in Kensington. She was a charming
woman; they all said so, the barristers and their wives who dined with us, and
the literary stockbrokers, and the budding politicians; oh, she was a charming
woman. She made me go to church in a silk hat and a frock coat, she took me to
classical concerts, and she was very fond of lectures on Sunday afternoon; and
she sat down to breakfast every morning at eight-thirty, and if I was late
breakfast was cold; and she read the right books, admired the right pictures,
and adored the right music. My God, how that woman bored me! She is charming
still, and she lives in the little red brick house in Kensington, with Morris
papers and Whistler&rsquo;s etchings on the walls, and gives the same nice
little dinner parties, with veal creams and ices from Gunter&rsquo;s, as she
did twenty years ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip did not ask by what means the ill-matched couple had separated, but
Athelny told him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Betty&rsquo;s not my wife, you know; my wife wouldn&rsquo;t divorce me.
The children are bastards, every jack one of them, and are they any the worse
for that? Betty was one of the maids in the little red brick house in
Kensington. Four or five years ago I was on my uppers, and I had seven
children, and I went to my wife and asked her to help me. She said she&rsquo;d
make me an allowance if I&rsquo;d give Betty up and go abroad. Can you see me
giving Betty up? We starved for a while instead. My wife said I loved the
gutter. I&rsquo;ve degenerated; I&rsquo;ve come down in the world; I earn three
pounds a week as press agent to a linendraper, and every day I thank God that
I&rsquo;m not in the little red brick house in Kensington.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sally brought in Cheddar cheese, and Athelny went on with his fluent
conversation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the greatest mistake in the world to think that one needs
money to bring up a family. You need money to make them gentlemen and ladies,
but I don&rsquo;t want my children to be ladies and gentlemen. Sally&rsquo;s
going to earn her living in another year. She&rsquo;s to be apprenticed to a
dressmaker, aren&rsquo;t you, Sally? And the boys are going to serve their
country. I want them all to go into the Navy; it&rsquo;s a jolly life and a
healthy life, good food, good pay, and a pension to end their days on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip lit his pipe. Athelny smoked cigarettes of Havana tobacco, which he
rolled himself. Sally cleared away. Philip was reserved, and it embarrassed him
to be the recipient of so many confidences. Athelny, with his powerful voice in
the diminutive body, with his bombast, with his foreign look, with his
emphasis, was an astonishing creature. He reminded Philip a good deal of
Cronshaw. He appeared to have the same independence of thought, the same
bohemianism, but he had an infinitely more vivacious temperament; his mind was
coarser, and he had not that interest in the abstract which made
Cronshaw&rsquo;s conversation so captivating. Athelny was very proud of the
county family to which he belonged; he showed Philip photographs of an
Elizabethan mansion, and told him:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Athelnys have lived there for seven centuries, my boy. Ah, if you
saw the chimney-pieces and the ceilings!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a cupboard in the wainscoting and from this he took a family tree. He
showed it to Philip with child-like satisfaction. It was indeed imposing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see how the family names recur, Thorpe, Athelstan, Harold, Edward;
I&rsquo;ve used the family names for my sons. And the girls, you see,
I&rsquo;ve given Spanish names to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
An uneasy feeling came to Philip that possibly the whole story was an elaborate
imposture, not told with any base motive, but merely from a wish to impress,
startle, and amaze. Athelny had told him that he was at Winchester; but Philip,
sensitive to differences of manner, did not feel that his host had the
characteristics of a man educated at a great public school. While he pointed
out the great alliances which his ancestors had formed, Philip amused himself
by wondering whether Athelny was not the son of some tradesman in Winchester,
auctioneer or coal-merchant, and whether a similarity of surname was not his
only connection with the ancient family whose tree he was displaying.

<h2>LXXXVIII</h2>

<p>
There was a knock at the door and a troop of children came in. They were clean
and tidy, now. Their faces shone with soap, and their hair was plastered down;
they were going to Sunday school under Sally&rsquo;s charge. Athelny joked with
them in his dramatic, exuberant fashion, and you could see that he was devoted
to them all. His pride in their good health and their good looks was touching.
Philip felt that they were a little shy in his presence, and when their father
sent them off they fled from the room in evident relief. In a few minutes Mrs.
Athelny appeared. She had taken her hair out of the curling pins and now wore
an elaborate fringe. She had on a plain black dress, a hat with cheap flowers,
and was forcing her hands, red and coarse from much work, into black kid
gloves.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to church, Athelny,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing you&rsquo;ll be wanting, is there?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Only your prayers, my Betty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t do you much good, you&rsquo;re too far gone for
that,&rdquo; she smiled. Then, turning to Philip, she drawled: &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t get him to go to church. He&rsquo;s no better than an
atheist.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t she look like Rubens&rsquo; second wife?&rdquo; cried
Athelny. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t she look splendid in a seventeenth-century
costume? That&rsquo;s the sort of wife to marry, my boy. Look at her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;d talk the hind leg off a donkey, Athelny,&rdquo;
she answered calmly.
</p>

<p>
She succeeded in buttoning her gloves, but before she went she turned to Philip
with a kindly, slightly embarrassed smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay to tea, won&rsquo;t you? Athelny likes someone to talk
to, and it&rsquo;s not often he gets anybody who&rsquo;s clever enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course he&rsquo;ll stay to tea,&rdquo; said Athelny. Then when his
wife had gone: &ldquo;I make a point of the children going to Sunday school,
and I like Betty to go to church. I think women ought to be religious. I
don&rsquo;t believe myself, but I like women and children to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip, strait-laced in matters of truth, was a little shocked by this airy
attitude.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But how can you look on while your children are being taught things
which you don&rsquo;t think are true?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re beautiful I don&rsquo;t much mind if they&rsquo;re not
true. It&rsquo;s asking a great deal that things should appeal to your reason
as well as to your sense of the aesthetic. I wanted Betty to become a Roman
Catholic, I should have liked to see her converted in a crown of paper flowers,
but she&rsquo;s hopelessly Protestant. Besides, religion is a matter of
temperament; you will believe anything if you have the religious turn of mind,
and if you haven&rsquo;t it doesn&rsquo;t matter what beliefs were instilled
into you, you will grow out of them. Perhaps religion is the best school of
morality. It is like one of those drugs you gentlemen use in medicine which
carries another in solution: it is of no efficacy in itself, but enables the
other to be absorbed. You take your morality because it is combined with
religion; you lose the religion and the morality stays behind. A man is more
likely to be a good man if he has learned goodness through the love of God than
through a perusal of Herbert Spencer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was contrary to all Philip&rsquo;s ideas. He still looked upon
Christianity as a degrading bondage that must be cast away at any cost; it was
connected subconsciously in his mind with the dreary services in the cathedral
at Tercanbury, and the long hours of boredom in the cold church at Blackstable;
and the morality of which Athelny spoke was to him no more than a part of the
religion which a halting intelligence preserved, when it had laid aside the
beliefs which alone made it reasonable. But while he was meditating a reply
Athelny, more interested in hearing himself speak than in discussion, broke
into a tirade upon Roman Catholicism. For him it was an essential part of
Spain; and Spain meant much to him, because he had escaped to it from the
conventionality which during his married life he had found so irksome. With
large gestures and in the emphatic tone which made what he said so striking,
Athelny described to Philip the Spanish cathedrals with their vast dark spaces,
the massive gold of the altar-pieces, and the sumptuous iron-work, gilt and
faded, the air laden with incense, the silence: Philip almost saw the Canons in
their short surplices of lawn, the acolytes in red, passing from the sacristy
to the choir; he almost heard the monotonous chanting of vespers. The names
which Athelny mentioned, Avila, Tarragona, Saragossa, Segovia, Cordova, were
like trumpets in his heart. He seemed to see the great gray piles of granite
set in old Spanish towns amid a landscape tawny, wild, and windswept.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always thought I should love to go to Seville,&rdquo; he said
casually, when Athelny, with one hand dramatically uplifted, paused for a
moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Seville!&rdquo; cried Athelny. &ldquo;No, no, don&rsquo;t go there.
Seville: it brings to the mind girls dancing with castanets, singing in gardens
by the Guadalquivir, bull-fights, orange-blossom, mantillas, mantones de
Manila. It is the Spain of comic opera and Montmartre. Its facile charm can
offer permanent entertainment only to an intelligence which is superficial.
Theophile Gautier got out of Seville all that it has to offer. We who come
after him can only repeat his sensations. He put large fat hands on the obvious
and there is nothing but the obvious there; and it is all finger-marked and
frayed. Murillo is its painter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Athelny got up from his chair, walked over to the Spanish cabinet, let down the
front with its great gilt hinges and gorgeous lock, and displayed a series of
little drawers. He took out a bundle of photographs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know El Greco?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I remember one of the men in Paris was awfully impressed by
him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;El Greco was the painter of Toledo. Betty couldn&rsquo;t find the
photograph I wanted to show you. It&rsquo;s a picture that El Greco painted of
the city he loved, and it&rsquo;s truer than any photograph. Come and sit at
the table.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip dragged his chair forward, and Athelny set the photograph before him. He
looked at it curiously, for a long time, in silence. He stretched out his hand
for other photographs, and Athelny passed them to him. He had never before seen
the work of that enigmatic master; and at the first glance he was bothered by
the arbitrary drawing: the figures were extraordinarily elongated; the heads
were very small; the attitudes were extravagant. This was not realism, and yet,
and yet even in the photographs you had the impression of a troubling reality.
Athelny was describing eagerly, with vivid phrases, but Philip only heard
vaguely what he said. He was puzzled. He was curiously moved. These pictures
seemed to offer some meaning to him, but he did not know what the meaning was.
There were portraits of men with large, melancholy eyes which seemed to say you
knew not what; there were long monks in the Franciscan habit or in the
Dominican, with distraught faces, making gestures whose sense escaped you;
there was an Assumption of the Virgin; there was a Crucifixion in which the
painter by some magic of feeling had been able to suggest that the flesh of
Christ&rsquo;s dead body was not human flesh only but divine; and there was an
Ascension in which the Saviour seemed to surge up towards the empyrean and yet
to stand upon the air as steadily as though it were solid ground: the uplifted
arms of the Apostles, the sweep of their draperies, their ecstatic gestures,
gave an impression of exultation and of holy joy. The background of nearly all
was the sky by night, the dark night of the soul, with wild clouds swept by
strange winds of hell and lit luridly by an uneasy moon.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen that sky in Toledo over and over again,&rdquo; said
Athelny. &ldquo;I have an idea that when first El Greco came to the city it was
by such a night, and it made so vehement an impression upon him that he could
never get away from it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip remembered how Clutton had been affected by this strange master, whose
work he now saw for the first time. He thought that Clutton was the most
interesting of all the people he had known in Paris. His sardonic manner, his
hostile aloofness, had made it difficult to know him; but it seemed to Philip,
looking back, that there had been in him a tragic force, which sought vainly to
express itself in painting. He was a man of unusual character, mystical after
the fashion of a time that had no leaning to mysticism, who was impatient with
life because he found himself unable to say the things which the obscure
impulses of his heart suggested. His intellect was not fashioned to the uses of
the spirit. It was not surprising that he felt a deep sympathy with the Greek
who had devised a new technique to express the yearnings of his soul. Philip
looked again at the series of portraits of Spanish gentlemen, with ruffles and
pointed beards, their faces pale against the sober black of their clothes and
the darkness of the background. El Greco was the painter of the soul; and these
gentlemen, wan and wasted, not by exhaustion but by restraint, with their
tortured minds, seem to walk unaware of the beauty of the world; for their eyes
look only in their hearts, and they are dazzled by the glory of the unseen. No
painter has shown more pitilessly that the world is but a place of passage. The
souls of the men he painted speak their strange longings through their eyes:
their senses are miraculously acute, not for sounds and odours and colour, but
for the very subtle sensations of the soul. The noble walks with the monkish
heart within him, and his eyes see things which saints in their cells see too,
and he is unastounded. His lips are not lips that smile.
</p>

<p>
Philip, silent still, returned to the photograph of Toledo, which seemed to him
the most arresting picture of them all. He could not take his eyes off it. He
felt strangely that he was on the threshold of some new discovery in life. He
was tremulous with a sense of adventure. He thought for an instant of the love
that had consumed him: love seemed very trivial beside the excitement which now
leaped in his heart. The picture he looked at was a long one, with houses
crowded upon a hill; in one corner a boy was holding a large map of the town;
in another was a classical figure representing the river Tagus; and in the sky
was the Virgin surrounded by angels. It was a landscape alien to all
Philip&rsquo;s notion, for he had lived in circles that worshipped exact
realism; and yet here again, strangely to himself, he felt a reality greater
than any achieved by the masters in whose steps humbly he had sought to walk.
He heard Athelny say that the representation was so precise that when the
citizens of Toledo came to look at the picture they recognised their houses.
The painter had painted exactly what he saw but he had seen with the eyes of
the spirit. There was something unearthly in that city of pale gray. It was a
city of the soul seen by a wan light that was neither that of night nor day. It
stood on a green hill, but of a green not of this world, and it was surrounded
by massive walls and bastions to be stormed by no machines or engines of
man&rsquo;s invention, but by prayer and fasting, by contrite sighs and by
mortifications of the flesh. It was a stronghold of God. Those gray houses were
made of no stone known to masons, there was something terrifying in their
aspect, and you did not know what men might live in them. You might walk
through the streets and be unamazed to find them all deserted, and yet not
empty; for you felt a presence invisible and yet manifest to every inner sense.
It was a mystical city in which the imagination faltered like one who steps out
of the light into darkness; the soul walked naked to and fro, knowing the
unknowable, and conscious strangely of experience, intimate but inexpressible,
of the absolute. And without surprise, in that blue sky, real with a reality
that not the eye but the soul confesses, with its rack of light clouds driven
by strange breezes, like the cries and the sighs of lost souls, you saw the
Blessed Virgin with a gown of red and a cloak of blue, surrounded by winged
angels. Philip felt that the inhabitants of that city would have seen the
apparition without astonishment, reverent and thankful, and have gone their
ways.
</p>

<p>
Athelny spoke of the mystical writers of Spain, of Teresa de Avila, San Juan de
la Cruz, Fray Luis de Leon; in all of them was that passion for the unseen
which Philip felt in the pictures of El Greco: they seemed to have the power to
touch the incorporeal and see the invisible. They were Spaniards of their age,
in whom were tremulous all the mighty exploits of a great nation: their fancies
were rich with the glories of America and the green islands of the Caribbean
Sea; in their veins was the power that had come from age-long battling with the
Moor; they were proud, for they were masters of the world; and they felt in
themselves the wide distances, the tawny wastes, the snow-capped mountains of
Castile, the sunshine and the blue sky, and the flowering plains of Andalusia.
Life was passionate and manifold, and because it offered so much they felt a
restless yearning for something more; because they were human they were
unsatisfied; and they threw this eager vitality of theirs into a vehement
striving after the ineffable. Athelny was not displeased to find someone to
whom he could read the translations with which for some time he had amused his
leisure; and in his fine, vibrating voice he recited the canticle of the Soul
and Christ her lover, the lovely poem which begins with the words en una noche
oscura, and the noche serena of Fray Luis de Leon. He had translated them quite
simply, not without skill, and he had found words which at all events suggested
the rough-hewn grandeur of the original. The pictures of El Greco explained
them, and they explained the pictures.
</p>

<p>
Philip had cultivated a certain disdain for idealism. He had always had a
passion for life, and the idealism he had come across seemed to him for the
most part a cowardly shrinking from it. The idealist withdrew himself, because
he could not suffer the jostling of the human crowd; he had not the strength to
fight and so called the battle vulgar; he was vain, and since his fellows would
not take him at his own estimate, consoled himself with despising his fellows.
For Philip his type was Hayward, fair, languid, too fat now and rather bald,
still cherishing the remains of his good looks and still delicately proposing
to do exquisite things in the uncertain future; and at the back of this were
whiskey and vulgar amours of the street. It was in reaction from what Hayward
represented that Philip clamoured for life as it stood; sordidness, vice,
deformity, did not offend him; he declared that he wanted man in his nakedness;
and he rubbed his hands when an instance came before him of meanness, cruelty,
selfishness, or lust: that was the real thing. In Paris he had learned that
there was neither ugliness nor beauty, but only truth: the search after beauty
was sentimental. Had he not painted an advertisement of chocolat Menier in a
landscape in order to escape from the tyranny of prettiness?
</p>

<p>
But here he seemed to divine something new. He had been coming to it, all
hesitating, for some time, but only now was conscious of the fact; he felt
himself on the brink of a discovery. He felt vaguely that here was something
better than the realism which he had adored; but certainly it was not the
bloodless idealism which stepped aside from life in weakness; it was too
strong; it was virile; it accepted life in all its vivacity, ugliness and
beauty, squalor and heroism; it was realism still; but it was realism carried
to some higher pitch, in which facts were transformed by the more vivid light
in which they were seen. He seemed to see things more profoundly through the
grave eyes of those dead noblemen of Castile; and the gestures of the saints,
which at first had seemed wild and distorted, appeared to have some mysterious
significance. But he could not tell what that significance was. It was like a
message which it was very important for him to receive, but it was given him in
an unknown tongue, and he could not understand. He was always seeking for a
meaning in life, and here it seemed to him that a meaning was offered; but it
was obscure and vague. He was profoundly troubled. He saw what looked like the
truth as by flashes of lightning on a dark, stormy night you might see a
mountain range. He seemed to see that a man need not leave his life to chance,
but that his will was powerful; he seemed to see that self-control might be as
passionate and as active as the surrender to passion; he seemed to see that the
inward life might be as manifold, as varied, as rich with experience, as the
life of one who conquered realms and explored unknown lands.

<h2>LXXXIX</h2>

<p>
The conversation between Philip and Athelny was broken into by a clatter up the
stairs. Athelny opened the door for the children coming back from Sunday
school, and with laughter and shouting they came in. Gaily he asked them what
they had learned. Sally appeared for a moment, with instructions from her
mother that father was to amuse the children while she got tea ready; and
Athelny began to tell them one of Hans Andersen&rsquo;s stories. They were not
shy children, and they quickly came to the conclusion that Philip was not
formidable. Jane came and stood by him and presently settled herself on his
knees. It was the first time that Philip in his lonely life had been present in
a family circle: his eyes smiled as they rested on the fair children engrossed
in the fairy tale. The life of his new friend, eccentric as it appeared at
first glance, seemed now to have the beauty of perfect naturalness. Sally came
in once more.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now then, children, tea&rsquo;s ready,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
Jane slipped off Philip&rsquo;s knees, and they all went back to the kitchen.
Sally began to lay the cloth on the long Spanish table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mother says, shall she come and have tea with you?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;I can give the children their tea.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell your mother that we shall be proud and honoured if she will favour
us with her company,&rdquo; said Athelny.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to Philip that he could never say anything without an oratorical
flourish.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll lay for her,&rdquo; said Sally.
</p>

<p>
She came back again in a moment with a tray on which were a cottage loaf, a
slab of butter, and a jar of strawberry jam. While she placed the things on the
table her father chaffed her. He said it was quite time she was walking out; he
told Philip that she was very proud, and would have nothing to do with
aspirants to that honour who lined up at the door, two by two, outside the
Sunday school and craved the honour of escorting her home.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You do talk, father,&rdquo; said Sally, with her slow, good-natured
smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t think to look at her that a tailor&rsquo;s assistant
has enlisted in the army because she would not say how d&rsquo;you do to him
and an electrical engineer, an electrical engineer, mind you, has taken to
drink because she refused to share her hymn-book with him in church. I shudder
to think what will happen when she puts her hair up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;ll bring the tea along herself,&rdquo; said Sally.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sally never pays any attention to me,&rdquo; laughed Athelny, looking at
her with fond, proud eyes. &ldquo;She goes about her business indifferent to
wars, revolutions, and cataclysms. What a wife she&rsquo;ll make to an honest
man!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Athelny brought in the tea. She sat down and proceeded to cut bread and
butter. It amused Philip to see that she treated her husband as though he were
a child. She spread jam for him and cut up the bread and butter into convenient
slices for him to eat. She had taken off her hat; and in her Sunday dress,
which seemed a little tight for her, she looked like one of the farmers&rsquo;
wives whom Philip used to call on sometimes with his uncle when he was a small
boy. Then he knew why the sound of her voice was familiar to him. She spoke
just like the people round Blackstable.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What part of the country d&rsquo;you come from?&rdquo; he asked her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Kentish woman. I come from Ferne.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought as much. My uncle&rsquo;s Vicar of Blackstable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a funny thing now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was wondering
in Church just now whether you was any connection of Mr. Carey. Many&rsquo;s
the time I&rsquo;ve seen &rsquo;im. A cousin of mine married Mr. Barker of
Roxley Farm, over by Blackstable Church, and I used to go and stay there often
when I was a girl. Isn&rsquo;t that a funny thing now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked at him with a new interest, and a brightness came into her faded
eyes. She asked him whether he knew Ferne. It was a pretty village about ten
miles across country from Blackstable, and the Vicar had come over sometimes to
Blackstable for the harvest thanksgiving. She mentioned names of various
farmers in the neighbourhood. She was delighted to talk again of the country in
which her youth was spent, and it was a pleasure to her to recall scenes and
people that had remained in her memory with the tenacity peculiar to her class.
It gave Philip a queer sensation too. A breath of the country-side seemed to be
wafted into that panelled room in the middle of London. He seemed to see the
fat Kentish fields with their stately elms; and his nostrils dilated with the
scent of the air; it is laden with the salt of the North Sea, and that makes it
keen and sharp.
</p>

<p>
Philip did not leave the Athelnys&rsquo; till ten o&rsquo;clock. The children
came in to say good-night at eight and quite naturally put up their faces for
Philip to kiss. His heart went out to them. Sally only held out her hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sally never kisses gentlemen till she&rsquo;s seen them twice,&rdquo;
said her father.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must ask me again then,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t take any notice of what father says,&rdquo; remarked
Sally, with a smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a most self-possessed young woman,&rdquo; added her parent.
</p>

<p>
They had supper of bread and cheese and beer, while Mrs. Athelny was putting
the children to bed; and when Philip went into the kitchen to bid her
good-night (she had been sitting there, resting herself and reading The Weekly
Despatch) she invited him cordially to come again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s always a good dinner on Sundays so long as Athelny&rsquo;s
in work,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s a charity to come and talk to
him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
On the following Saturday Philip received a postcard from Athelny saying that
they were expecting him to dinner next day; but fearing their means were not
such that Mr. Athelny would desire him to accept, Philip wrote back that he
would only come to tea. He bought a large plum cake so that his entertainment
should cost nothing. He found the whole family glad to see him, and the cake
completed his conquest of the children. He insisted that they should all have
tea together in the kitchen, and the meal was noisy and hilarious.
</p>

<p>
Soon Philip got into the habit of going to Athelny&rsquo;s every Sunday. He
became a great favourite with the children, because he was simple and
unaffected and because it was so plain that he was fond of them. As soon as
they heard his ring at the door one of them popped a head out of window to make
sure it was he, and then they all rushed downstairs tumultuously to let him in.
They flung themselves into his arms. At tea they fought for the privilege of
sitting next to him. Soon they began to call him Uncle Philip.
</p>

<p>
Athelny was very communicative, and little by little Philip learned the various
stages of his life. He had followed many occupations, and it occurred to Philip
that he managed to make a mess of everything he attempted. He had been on a tea
plantation in Ceylon and a traveller in America for Italian wines; his
secretaryship of the water company in Toledo had lasted longer than any of his
employments; he had been a journalist and for some time had worked as
police-court reporter for an evening paper; he had been sub-editor of a paper
in the Midlands and editor of another on the Riviera. From all his occupations
he had gathered amusing anecdotes, which he told with a keen pleasure in his
own powers of entertainment. He had read a great deal, chiefly delighting in
books which were unusual; and he poured forth his stores of abstruse knowledge
with child-like enjoyment of the amazement of his hearers. Three or four years
before abject poverty had driven him to take the job of press-representative to
a large firm of drapers; and though he felt the work unworthy his abilities,
which he rated highly, the firmness of his wife and the needs of his family had
made him stick to it.

<p>
When he left the Athelnys&rsquo; Philip walked down Chancery Lane and along the
Strand to get a &rsquo;bus at the top of Parliament Street. One Sunday, when he
had known them about six weeks, he did this as usual, but he found the
Kennington &rsquo;bus full. It was June, but it had rained during the day and
the night was raw and cold. He walked up to Piccadilly Circus in order to get a
seat; the &rsquo;bus waited at the fountain, and when it arrived there seldom
had more than two or three people in it. This service ran every quarter of an
hour, and he had some time to wait. He looked idly at the crowd. The
public-houses were closing, and there were many people about. His mind was busy
with the ideas Athelny had the charming gift of suggesting.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly his heart stood still. He saw Mildred. He had not thought of her for
weeks. She was crossing over from the corner of Shaftesbury Avenue and stopped
at the shelter till a string of cabs passed by. She was watching her
opportunity and had no eyes for anything else. She wore a large black straw hat
with a mass of feathers on it and a black silk dress; at that time it was
fashionable for women to wear trains; the road was clear, and Mildred crossed,
her skirt trailing on the ground, and walked down Piccadilly. Philip, his heart
beating excitedly, followed her. He did not wish to speak to her, but he
wondered where she was going at that hour; he wanted to get a look at her face.
She walked slowly along and turned down Air Street and so got through into
Regent Street. She walked up again towards the Circus. Philip was puzzled. He
could not make out what she was doing. Perhaps she was waiting for somebody,
and he felt a great curiosity to know who it was. She overtook a short man in a
bowler hat, who was strolling very slowly in the same direction as herself; she
gave him a sidelong glance as she passed. She walked a few steps more till she
came to Swan and Edgar&rsquo;s, then stopped and waited, facing the road. When
the man came up she smiled. The man stared at her for a moment, turned away his
head, and sauntered on. Then Philip understood.
</p>

<p>
He was overwhelmed with horror. For a moment he felt such a weakness in his
legs that he could hardly stand; then he walked after her quickly; he touched
her on the arm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mildred.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She turned round with a violent start. He thought that she reddened, but in the
obscurity he could not see very well. For a while they stood and looked at one
another without speaking. At last she said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fancy seeing you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He did not know what to answer; he was horribly shaken; and the phrases that
chased one another through his brain seemed incredibly melodramatic.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful,&rdquo; he gasped, almost to himself.
</p>

<p>
She did not say anything more, she turned away from him, and looked down at the
pavement. He felt that his face was distorted with misery.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there anywhere we can go and talk?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk,&rdquo; she said sullenly. &ldquo;Leave me
alone, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The thought struck him that perhaps she was in urgent need of money and could
not afford to go away at that hour.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a couple of sovereigns on me if you&rsquo;re hard
up,&rdquo; he blurted out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean. I was just walking along here on my
way back to my lodgings. I expected to meet one of the girls from where I
work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t lie now,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
Then he saw that she was crying, and he repeated his question.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we go and talk somewhere? Can&rsquo;t I come back to your
rooms?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
allowed to take gentlemen in there. If you like I&rsquo;ll meet you
tomorrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He felt certain that she would not keep an appointment. He was not going to let
her go.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. You must take me somewhere now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, there is a room I know, but they&rsquo;ll charge six shillings for
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind that. Where is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She gave him the address, and he called a cab. They drove to a shabby street
beyond the British Museum in the neighbourhood of the Gray&rsquo;s Inn Road,
and she stopped the cab at the corner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t like you to drive up to the door,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
They were the first words either of them had spoken since getting into the cab.
They walked a few yards and Mildred knocked three times, sharply, at a door.
Philip noticed in the fanlight a cardboard on which was an announcement that
apartments were to let. The door was opened quietly, and an elderly, tall woman
let them in. She gave Philip a stare and then spoke to Mildred in an undertone.
Mildred led Philip along a passage to a room at the back. It was quite dark;
she asked him for a match, and lit the gas; there was no globe, and the gas
flared shrilly. Philip saw that he was in a dingy little bed-room with a suite
of furniture, painted to look like pine much too large for it; the lace
curtains were very dirty; the grate was hidden by a large paper fan. Mildred
sank on the chair which stood by the side of the chimney-piece. Philip sat on
the edge of the bed. He felt ashamed. He saw now that Mildred&rsquo;s cheeks
were thick with rouge, her eyebrows were blackened; but she looked thin and
ill, and the red on her cheeks exaggerated the greenish pallor of her skin. She
stared at the paper fan in a listless fashion. Philip could not think what to
say, and he had a choking in his throat as if he were going to cry. He covered
his eyes with his hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My God, it is awful,&rdquo; he groaned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ve got to fuss about. I should have
thought you&rsquo;d have been rather pleased.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip did not answer, and in a moment she broke into a sob.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think I do it because I like it, do you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my dear,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, I&rsquo;m so
awfully sorry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do me a fat lot of good.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again Philip found nothing to say. He was desperately afraid of saying anything
which she might take for a reproach or a sneer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the baby?&rdquo; he asked at last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got her with me in London. I hadn&rsquo;t got the money to
keep her on at Brighton, so I had to take her. I&rsquo;ve got a room up
Highbury way. I told them I was on the stage. It&rsquo;s a long way to have to
come down to the West End every day, but it&rsquo;s a rare job to find anyone
who&rsquo;ll let to ladies at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t they take you back at the shop?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get any work to do anywhere. I walked my legs off
looking for work. I did get a job once, but I was off for a week because I was
queer, and when I went back they said they didn&rsquo;t want me any more. You
can&rsquo;t blame them either, can you? Them places, they can&rsquo;t afford to
have girls that aren&rsquo;t strong.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look very well now,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t fit to come out tonight, but I couldn&rsquo;t help
myself, I wanted the money. I wrote to Emil and told him I was broke, but he
never even answered the letter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You might have written to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like to, not after what happened, and I didn&rsquo;t want
you to know I was in difficulties. I shouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised if
you&rsquo;d just told me I&rsquo;d only got what I deserved.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know me very well, do you, even now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
For a moment he remembered all the anguish he had suffered on her account, and
he was sick with the recollection of his pain. But it was no more than
recollection. When he looked at her he knew that he no longer loved her. He was
very sorry for her, but he was glad to be free. Watching her gravely, he asked
himself why he had been so besotted with passion for her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a gentleman in every sense of the word,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the only one I&rsquo;ve ever met.&rdquo; She paused for a
minute and then flushed. &ldquo;I hate asking you, Philip, but can you spare me
anything?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky I&rsquo;ve got some money on me. I&rsquo;m afraid
I&rsquo;ve only got two pounds.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He gave her the sovereigns.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay you back, Philip.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t
worry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had said nothing that he wanted to say. They had talked as if the whole
thing were natural; and it looked as though she would go now, back to the
horror of her life, and he would be able to do nothing to prevent it. She had
got up to take the money, and they were both standing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Am I keeping you?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I suppose you want to be
getting home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m in no hurry,&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to have a chance of sitting down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Those words, with all they implied, tore his heart, and it was dreadfully
painful to see the weary way in which she sank back into the chair. The silence
lasted so long that Philip in his embarrassment lit a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very good of you not to have said anything disagreeable to
me, Philip. I thought you might say I didn&rsquo;t know what all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He saw that she was crying again. He remembered how she had come to him when
Emil Miller had deserted her and how she had wept. The recollection of her
suffering and of his own humiliation seemed to render more overwhelming the
compassion he felt now.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I could only get out of it!&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;I hate it so.
I&rsquo;m unfit for the life, I&rsquo;m not the sort of girl for that.
I&rsquo;d do anything to get away from it, I&rsquo;d be a servant if I could.
Oh, I wish I was dead.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And in pity for herself she broke down now completely. She sobbed hysterically,
and her thin body was shaken.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t know what it is. Nobody knows till they&rsquo;ve
done it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip could not bear to see her cry. He was tortured by the horror of her
position.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor child,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Poor child.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was deeply moved. Suddenly he had an inspiration. It filled him with a
perfect ecstasy of happiness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here, if you want to get away from it, I&rsquo;ve got an idea.
I&rsquo;m frightfully hard up just now, I&rsquo;ve got to be as economical as I
can; but I&rsquo;ve got a sort of little flat now in Kennington and I&rsquo;ve
got a spare room. If you like you and the baby can come and live there. I pay a
woman three and sixpence a week to keep the place clean and to do a little
cooking for me. You could do that and your food wouldn&rsquo;t come to much
more than the money I should save on her. It doesn&rsquo;t cost any more to
feed two than one, and I don&rsquo;t suppose the baby eats much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She stopped crying and looked at him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you mean to say that you could take me back after all
that&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip flushed a little in embarrassment at what he had to say.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to mistake me. I&rsquo;m just giving you a room
which doesn&rsquo;t cost me anything and your food. I don&rsquo;t expect
anything more from you than that you should do exactly the same as the woman I
have in does. Except for that I don&rsquo;t want anything from you at all. I
daresay you can cook well enough for that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She sprang to her feet and was about to come towards him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are good to me, Philip.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, please stop where you are,&rdquo; he said hurriedly, putting out his
hand as though to push her away.
</p>

<p>
He did not know why it was, but he could not bear the thought that she should
touch him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be anything more than a friend to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are good to me,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;You are good to
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Does that mean you&rsquo;ll come?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;d do anything to get away from this. You&rsquo;ll never
regret what you&rsquo;ve done, Philip, never. When can I come, Philip?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better come tomorrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Suddenly she burst into tears again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What on earth are you crying for now?&rdquo; he smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so grateful to you. I don&rsquo;t know how I can ever make it
up to you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right. You&rsquo;d better go home now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He wrote out the address and told her that if she came at half past five he
would be ready for her. It was so late that he had to walk home, but it did not
seem a long way, for he was intoxicated with delight; he seemed to walk on air.
</p>

<h2>XCI</h2>

<p>
Next day he got up early to make the room ready for Mildred. He told the woman
who had looked after him that he would not want her any more. Mildred came
about six, and Philip, who was watching from the window, went down to let her
in and help her to bring up the luggage: it consisted now of no more than three
large parcels wrapped in brown paper, for she had been obliged to sell
everything that was not absolutely needful. She wore the same black silk dress
she had worn the night before, and, though she had now no rouge on her cheeks,
there was still about her eyes the black which remained after a perfunctory
wash in the morning: it made her look very ill. She was a pathetic figure as
she stepped out of the cab with the baby in her arms. She seemed a little shy,
and they found nothing but commonplace things to say to one another.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve got here all right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never lived in this part of London before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip showed her the room. It was that in which Cronshaw had died. Philip,
though he thought it absurd, had never liked the idea of going back to it; and
since Cronshaw&rsquo;s death he had remained in the little room, sleeping on a
fold-up bed, into which he had first moved in order to make his friend
comfortable. The baby was sleeping placidly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t recognise her, I expect,&rdquo; said Mildred.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not seen her since we took her down to Brighton.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where shall I put her? She&rsquo;s so heavy I can&rsquo;t carry her very
long.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I haven&rsquo;t got a cradle,&rdquo; said Philip, with
a nervous laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;ll sleep with me. She always does.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mildred put the baby in an arm-chair and looked round the room. She recognised
most of the things which she had known in his old diggings. Only one thing was
new, a head and shoulders of Philip which Lawson had painted at the end of the
preceding summer; it hung over the chimney-piece; Mildred looked at it
critically.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In some ways I like it and in some ways I don&rsquo;t. I think
you&rsquo;re better looking than that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Things are looking up,&rdquo; laughed Philip. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never
told me I was good-looking before.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not one to worry myself about a man&rsquo;s looks. I
don&rsquo;t like good-looking men. They&rsquo;re too conceited for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her eyes travelled round the room in an instinctive search for a looking-glass,
but there was none; she put up her hand and patted her large fringe.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll the other people in the house say to my being here?&rdquo;
she asked suddenly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s only a man and his wife living here. He&rsquo;s out
all day, and I never see her except on Saturday to pay my rent. They keep
entirely to themselves. I&rsquo;ve not spoken two words to either of them since
I came.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mildred went into the bedroom to undo her things and put them away. Philip
tried to read, but his spirits were too high: he leaned back in his chair,
smoking a cigarette, and with smiling eyes looked at the sleeping child. He
felt very happy. He was quite sure that he was not at all in love with Mildred.
He was surprised that the old feeling had left him so completely; he discerned
in himself a faint physical repulsion from her; and he thought that if he
touched her it would give him goose-flesh. He could not understand himself.
Presently, knocking at the door, she came in again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, you needn&rsquo;t knock,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Have you made the
tour of the mansion?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the smallest kitchen I&rsquo;ve ever seen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find it large enough to cook our sumptuous repasts,&rdquo;
he retorted lightly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see there&rsquo;s nothing in. I&rsquo;d better go out and get
something.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but I venture to remind you that we must be devilish
economical.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What shall I get for supper?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better get what you think you can cook,&rdquo; laughed
Philip.
</p>

<p>
He gave her some money and she went out. She came in half an hour later and put
her purchases on the table. She was out of breath from climbing the stairs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, you are anaemic,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to
dose you with Blaud&rsquo;s Pills.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It took me some time to find the shops. I bought some liver.
That&rsquo;s tasty, isn&rsquo;t it? And you can&rsquo;t eat much of it, so
it&rsquo;s more economical than butcher&rsquo;s meat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a gas stove in the kitchen, and when she had put the liver on,
Mildred came into the sitting-room to lay the cloth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why are you only laying one place?&rdquo; asked Philip.
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to eat anything?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mildred flushed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought you mightn&rsquo;t like me to have my meals with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why on earth not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m only a servant, aren&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be an ass. How can you be so silly?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He smiled, but her humility gave him a curious twist in his heart. Poor thing!
He remembered what she had been when first he knew her. He hesitated for an
instant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m conferring any benefit on you,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s simply a business arrangement, I&rsquo;m giving you
board and lodging in return for your work. You don&rsquo;t owe me anything. And
there&rsquo;s nothing humiliating to you in it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She did not answer, but tears rolled heavily down her cheeks. Philip knew from
his experience at the hospital that women of her class looked upon service as
degrading: he could not help feeling a little impatient with her; but he blamed
himself, for it was clear that she was tired and ill. He got up and helped her
to lay another place at the table. The baby was awake now, and Mildred had
prepared some Mellin&rsquo;s Food for it. The liver and bacon were ready and
they sat down. For economy&rsquo;s sake Philip had given up drinking anything
but water, but he had in the house a half a bottle of whiskey, and he thought a
little would do Mildred good. He did his best to make the supper pass
cheerfully, but Mildred was subdued and exhausted. When they had finished she
got up to put the baby to bed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll do well to turn in early yourself,&rdquo; said
Philip. &ldquo;You look absolute done up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I will after I&rsquo;ve washed up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip lit his pipe and began to read. It was pleasant to hear somebody moving
about in the next room. Sometimes his loneliness had oppressed him. Mildred
came in to clear the table, and he heard the clatter of plates as she washed
up. Philip smiled as he thought how characteristic it was of her that she
should do all that in a black silk dress. But he had work to do, and he brought
his book up to the table. He was reading Osler&rsquo;s Medicine, which had
recently taken the place in the students&rsquo; favour of Taylor&rsquo;s work,
for many years the text-book most in use. Presently Mildred came in, rolling
down her sleeves. Philip gave her a casual glance, but did not move; the
occasion was curious, and he felt a little nervous. He feared that Mildred
might imagine he was going to make a nuisance of himself, and he did not quite
know how without brutality to reassure her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By the way, I&rsquo;ve got a lecture at nine, so I should want breakfast
at a quarter past eight. Can you manage that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes. Why, when I was in Parliament Street I used to catch the
eight-twelve from Herne Hill every morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll find your room comfortable. You&rsquo;ll be a
different woman tomorrow after a long night in bed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you work till late?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I generally work till about eleven or half-past.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say good-night then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The table was between them. He did not offer to shake hands with her. She shut
the door quietly. He heard her moving about in the bed-room, and in a little
while he heard the creaking of the bed as she got in.

<h2>XCII</h2>

<p>
The following day was Tuesday. Philip as usual hurried through his breakfast
and dashed off to get to his lecture at nine. He had only time to exchange a
few words with Mildred. When he came back in the evening he found her seated at
the window, darning his socks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, you are industrious,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;What have you been
doing with yourself all day?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I gave the place a good cleaning and then I took baby out for a
little.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She was wearing an old black dress, the same as she had worn as uniform when
she served in the tea-shop; it was shabby, but she looked better in it than in
the silk of the day before. The baby was sitting on the floor. She looked up at
Philip with large, mysterious eyes and broke into a laugh when he sat down
beside her and began playing with her bare toes. The afternoon sun came into
the room and shed a mellow light.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather jolly to come back and find someone about the place. A
woman and a baby make very good decoration in a room.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had gone to the hospital dispensary and got a bottle of Blaud&rsquo;s Pills,
He gave them to Mildred and told her she must take them after each meal. It was
a remedy she was used to, for she had taken it off and on ever since she was
sixteen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Lawson would love that green skin of yours,&rdquo; said
Philip. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d say it was so paintable, but I&rsquo;m terribly
matter of fact nowadays, and I shan&rsquo;t be happy till you&rsquo;re as pink
and white as a milkmaid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I feel better already.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
After a frugal supper Philip filled his pouch with tobacco and put on his hat.
It was on Tuesdays that he generally went to the tavern in Beak Street, and he
was glad that this day came so soon after Mildred&rsquo;s arrival, for he
wanted to make his relations with her perfectly clear.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you going out?&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, on Tuesdays I give myself a night off. I shall see you tomorrow.
Good-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip always went to the tavern with a sense of pleasure. Macalister, the
philosophic stockbroker, was generally there and glad to argue upon any subject
under the sun; Hayward came regularly when he was in London; and though he and
Macalister disliked one another they continued out of habit to meet on that one
evening in the week. Macalister thought Hayward a poor creature, and sneered at
his delicacies of sentiment: he asked satirically about Hayward&rsquo;s
literary work and received with scornful smiles his vague suggestions of future
masterpieces; their arguments were often heated; but the punch was good, and
they were both fond of it; towards the end of the evening they generally
composed their differences and thought each other capital fellows. This evening
Philip found them both there, and Lawson also; Lawson came more seldom now that
he was beginning to know people in London and went out to dinner a good deal.
They were all on excellent terms with themselves, for Macalister had given them
a good thing on the Stock Exchange, and Hayward and Lawson had made fifty
pounds apiece. It was a great thing for Lawson, who was extravagant and earned
little money: he had arrived at that stage of the portrait-painter&rsquo;s
career when he was noticed a good deal by the critics and found a number of
aristocratic ladies who were willing to allow him to paint them for nothing (it
advertised them both, and gave the great ladies quite an air of patronesses of
the arts); but he very seldom got hold of the solid philistine who was ready to
pay good money for a portrait of his wife. Lawson was brimming over with
satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most ripping way of making money that I&rsquo;ve ever
struck,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have to put my hand in my pocket
for sixpence.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You lost something by not being here last Tuesday, young man,&rdquo;
said Macalister to Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My God, why didn&rsquo;t you write to me?&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;If
you only knew how useful a hundred pounds would be to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, there wasn&rsquo;t time for that. One has to be on the spot. I heard
of a good thing last Tuesday, and I asked these fellows if they&rsquo;d like to
have a flutter, I bought them a thousand shares on Wednesday morning, and there
was a rise in the afternoon so I sold them at once. I made fifty pounds for
each of them and a couple of hundred for myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was sick with envy. He had recently sold the last mortgage in which his
small fortune had been invested and now had only six hundred pounds left. He
was panic-stricken sometimes when he thought of the future. He had still to
keep himself for two years before he could be qualified, and then he meant to
try for hospital appointments, so that he could not expect to earn anything for
three years at least. With the most rigid economy he would not have more than a
hundred pounds left then. It was very little to have as a stand-by in case he
was ill and could not earn money or found himself at any time without work. A
lucky gamble would make all the difference to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; said Macalister.
&ldquo;Something is sure to turn up soon. There&rsquo;ll be a boom in South
Africans again one of these days, and then I&rsquo;ll see what I can do for
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Macalister was in the Kaffir market and often told them stories of the sudden
fortunes that had been made in the great boom of a year or two back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t forget next time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They sat on talking till nearly midnight, and Philip, who lived furthest off,
was the first to go. If he did not catch the last tram he had to walk, and that
made him very late. As it was he did not reach home till nearly half past
twelve. When he got upstairs he was surprised to find Mildred still sitting in
his arm-chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why on earth aren&rsquo;t you in bed?&rdquo; he cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t sleepy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You ought to go to bed all the same. It would rest you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She did not move. He noticed that since supper she had changed into her black
silk dress.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d rather wait up for you in case you wanted
anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
 She looked at him, and the shadow of a smile played upon her thin pale lips.
 Philip was not sure whether he understood or not. He was slightly embarrassed,
 but assumed a cheerful, matter-of-fact air.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very nice of you, but it&rsquo;s very naughty also. Run off
to bed as fast as you can, or you won&rsquo;t be able to get up tomorrow
morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel like going to bed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; he said coldly.
</p>

<p>
She got up, a little sulkily, and went into her room. He smiled when he heard
her lock the door loudly.
</p>

<p>
The next few days passed without incident. Mildred settled down in her new
surroundings. When Philip hurried off after breakfast she had the whole morning
to do the housework. They ate very simply, but she liked to take a long time to
buy the few things they needed; she could not be bothered to cook anything for
her dinner, but made herself some cocoa and ate bread and butter; then she took
the baby out in the gocart, and when she came in spent the rest of the
afternoon in idleness. She was tired out, and it suited her to do so little.
She made friends with Philip&rsquo;s forbidding landlady over the rent, which
he left with Mildred to pay, and within a week was able to tell him more about
his neighbours than he had learned in a year.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a very nice woman,&rdquo; said Mildred. &ldquo;Quite the
lady. I told her we was married.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you think that was necessary?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I had to tell her something. It looks so funny me being here and
not married to you. I didn&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;d think of me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose she believed you for a moment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That she did, I lay. I told her we&rsquo;d been married two
years&mdash;I had to say that, you know, because of baby&mdash;only your people
wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it, because you was only a student&rdquo;&mdash;she
pronounced it stoodent&mdash;&ldquo;and so we had to keep it a secret, but
they&rsquo;d given way now and we were all going down to stay with them in the
summer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a past mistress of the cock-and-bull story,&rdquo; said
Philip.
</p>

<p>
He was vaguely irritated that Mildred still had this passion for telling fibs.
In the last two years she had learnt nothing. But he shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When all&rsquo;s said and done,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;she
hasn&rsquo;t had much chance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was a beautiful evening, warm and cloudless, and the people of South London
seemed to have poured out into the streets. There was that restlessness in the
air which seizes the cockney sometimes when a turn in the weather calls him
into the open. After Mildred had cleared away the supper she went and stood at
the window. The street noises came up to them, noises of people calling to one
another, of the passing traffic, of a barrel-organ in the distance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you must work tonight, Philip?&rdquo; she asked him, with a
wistful expression.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I ought, but I don&rsquo;t know that I must. Why, d&rsquo;you want me to
do anything else?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to go out for a bit. Couldn&rsquo;t we take a ride on the
top of a tram?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just go and put on my hat,&rdquo; she said joyfully.
</p>

<p>
The night made it almost impossible to stay indoors. The baby was asleep and
could be safely left; Mildred said she had always left it alone at night when
she went out; it never woke. She was in high spirits when she came back with
her hat on. She had taken the opportunity to put on a little rouge. Philip
thought it was excitement which had brought a faint colour to her pale cheeks;
he was touched by her child-like delight, and reproached himself for the
austerity with which he had treated her. She laughed when she got out into the
air. The first tram they saw was going towards Westminster Bridge and they got
on it. Philip smoked his pipe, and they looked at the crowded street. The shops
were open, gaily lit, and people were doing their shopping for the next day.
They passed a music-hall called the Canterbury and Mildred cried out:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Philip, do let&rsquo;s go there. I haven&rsquo;t been to a
music-hall for months.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford stalls, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind, I shall be quite happy in the gallery.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They got down and walked back a hundred yards till they came to the doors. They
got capital seats for sixpence each, high up but not in the gallery, and the
night was so fine that there was plenty of room. Mildred&rsquo;s eyes
glistened. She enjoyed herself thoroughly. There was a simple-mindedness in her
which touched Philip. She was a puzzle to him. Certain things in her still
pleased him, and he thought that there was a lot in her which was very good:
she had been badly brought up, and her life was hard; he had blamed her for
much that she could not help; and it was his own fault if he had asked virtues
from her which it was not in her power to give. Under different circumstances
she might have been a charming girl. She was extraordinarily unfit for the
battle of life. As he watched her now in profile, her mouth slightly open and
that delicate flush on her cheeks, he thought she looked strangely virginal. He
felt an overwhelming compassion for her, and with all his heart he forgave her
for the misery she had caused him. The smoky atmosphere made Philip&rsquo;s
eyes ache, but when he suggested going she turned to him with beseeching face
and asked him to stay till the end. He smiled and consented. She took his hand
and held it for the rest of the performance. When they streamed out with the
audience into the crowded street she did not want to go home; they wandered up
the Westminster Bridge Road, looking at the people.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not had such a good time as this for months,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
Philip&rsquo;s heart was full, and he was thankful to the fates because he had
carried out his sudden impulse to take Mildred and her baby into his flat. It
was very pleasant to see her happy gratitude. At last she grew tired and they
jumped on a tram to go home; it was late now, and when they got down and turned
into their own street there was no one about. Mildred slipped her arm through
his.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like old times, Phil,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
She had never called him Phil before, that was what Griffiths called him; and
even now it gave him a curious pang. He remembered how much he had wanted to
die then; his pain had been so great that he had thought quite seriously of
committing suicide. It all seemed very long ago. He smiled at his past self.
Now he felt nothing for Mildred but infinite pity. They reached the house, and
when they got into the sitting-room Philip lit the gas.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is the baby all right?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just go in and see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When she came back it was to say that it had not stirred since she left it. It
was a wonderful child. Philip held out his hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, good-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you want to go to bed already?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nearly one. I&rsquo;m not used to late hours these
days,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
She took his hand and holding it looked into his eyes with a little smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Phil, the other night in that room, when you asked me to come and stay
here, I didn&rsquo;t mean what you thought I meant, when you said you
didn&rsquo;t want me to be anything to you except just to cook and that sort of
thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; answered Philip, withdrawing his hand. &ldquo;I
did.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be such an old silly,&rdquo; she laughed.
</p>

<p>
He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I meant it quite seriously. I shouldn&rsquo;t have asked you to stay
here on any other condition.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I feel I couldn&rsquo;t. I can&rsquo;t explain it, but it would spoil it
all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She shrugged her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, very well, it&rsquo;s just as you choose. I&rsquo;m not one to go
down on my hands and knees for that, and chance it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She went out, slamming the door behind her.
</p>

<h2>XCIII</h2>

<p>
Next morning Mildred was sulky and taciturn. She remained in her room till it
was time to get the dinner ready. She was a bad cook and could do little more
than chops and steaks; and she did not know how to use up odds and ends, so
that Philip was obliged to spend more money than he had expected. When she
served up she sat down opposite Philip, but would eat nothing; he remarked on
it; she said she had a bad headache and was not hungry. He was glad that he had
somewhere to spend the rest of the day; the Athelnys were cheerful and
friendly. It was a delightful and an unexpected thing to realise that everyone
in that household looked forward with pleasure to his visit. Mildred had gone
to bed when he came back, but next day she was still silent. At supper she sat
with a haughty expression on her face and a little frown between her eyes. It
made Philip impatient, but he told himself that he must be considerate to her;
he was bound to make allowance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very silent,&rdquo; he said, with a pleasant smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m paid to cook and clean, I didn&rsquo;t know I was expected to
talk as well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He thought it an ungracious answer, but if they were going to live together he
must do all he could to make things go easily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re cross with me about the other
night,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
It was an awkward thing to speak about, but apparently it was necessary to
discuss it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; she answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t be angry with me. I should never have asked you to
come and live here if I&rsquo;d not meant our relations to be merely friendly.
I suggested it because I thought you wanted a home and you would have a chance
of looking about for something to do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t think I care.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t for a moment,&rdquo; he hastened to say. &ldquo;You
mustn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m ungrateful. I realise that you only proposed it
for my sake. It&rsquo;s just a feeling I have, and I can&rsquo;t help it, it
would make the whole thing ugly and horrid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are funny,&rdquo; she said, looking at him curiously. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t make you out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She was not angry with him now, but puzzled; she had no idea what he meant: she
accepted the situation, she had indeed a vague feeling that he was behaving in
a very noble fashion and that she ought to admire it; but also she felt
inclined to laugh at him and perhaps even to despise him a little.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a rum customer,&rdquo; she thought.
</p>

<p>
Life went smoothly enough with them. Philip spent all day at the hospital and
worked at home in the evening except when he went to the Athelnys&rsquo; or to
the tavern in Beak Street. Once the physician for whom he clerked asked him to
a solemn dinner, and two or three times he went to parties given by
fellow-students. Mildred accepted the monotony of her life. If she minded that
Philip left her sometimes by herself in the evening she never mentioned it.
Occasionally he took her to a music hall. He carried out his intention that the
only tie between them should be the domestic service she did in return for
board and lodging. She had made up her mind that it was no use trying to get
work that summer, and with Philip&rsquo;s approval determined to stay where she
was till the autumn. She thought it would be easy to get something to do then.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As far as I&rsquo;m concerned you can stay on here when you&rsquo;ve got
a job if it&rsquo;s convenient. The room&rsquo;s there, and the woman who did
for me before can come in to look after the baby.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He grew very much attached to Mildred&rsquo;s child. He had a naturally
affectionate disposition, which had had little opportunity to display itself.
Mildred was not unkind to the little girl. She looked after her very well and
once when she had a bad cold proved herself a devoted nurse; but the child
bored her, and she spoke to her sharply when she bothered; she was fond of her,
but had not the maternal passion which might have induced her to forget
herself. Mildred had no demonstrativeness, and she found the manifestations of
affection ridiculous. When Philip sat with the baby on his knees, playing with
it and kissing it, she laughed at him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t make more fuss of her if you was her father,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re perfectly silly with the child.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip flushed, for he hated to be laughed at. It was absurd to be so devoted
to another man&rsquo;s baby, and he was a little ashamed of the overflowing of
his heart. But the child, feeling Philip&rsquo;s attachment, would put her face
against his or nestle in his arms.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very fine for you,&rdquo; said Mildred. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t have any of the disagreeable part of it. How would you like being
kept awake for an hour in the middle of the night because her ladyship
wouldn&rsquo;t go to sleep?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip remembered all sorts of things of his childhood which he thought he had
long forgotten. He took hold of the baby&rsquo;s toes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This little pig went to market, this little pig stayed at home.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When he came home in the evening and entered the sitting-room his first glance
was for the baby sprawling on the floor, and it gave him a little thrill of
delight to hear the child&rsquo;s crow of pleasure at seeing him. Mildred
taught her to call him daddy, and when the child did this for the first time of
her own accord, laughed immoderately.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder if you&rsquo;re that stuck on baby because she&rsquo;s
mine,&rdquo; asked Mildred, &ldquo;or if you&rsquo;d be the same with
anybody&rsquo;s baby.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never known anybody else&rsquo;s baby, so I can&rsquo;t
say,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
Towards the end of his second term as in-patients&rsquo; clerk a piece of good
fortune befell Philip. It was the middle of July. He went one Tuesday evening
to the tavern in Beak Street and found nobody there but Macalister. They sat
together, chatting about their absent friends, and after a while Macalister
said to him:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, by the way, I heard of a rather good thing today, New Kleinfonteins;
it&rsquo;s a gold mine in Rhodesia. If you&rsquo;d like to have a flutter you
might make a bit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip had been waiting anxiously for such an opportunity, but now that it came
he hesitated. He was desperately afraid of losing money. He had little of the
gambler&rsquo;s spirit.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to, but I don&rsquo;t know if I dare risk it. How much
could I lose if things went wrong?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have spoken of it, only you seemed so keen about
it,&rdquo; Macalister answered coldly.
</p>

<p>
Philip felt that Macalister looked upon him as rather a donkey.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully keen on making a bit,&rdquo; he laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t make money unless you&rsquo;re prepared to risk
money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Macalister began to talk of other things and Philip, while he was answering
him, kept thinking that if the venture turned out well the stockbroker would be
very facetious at his expense next time they met. Macalister had a sarcastic
tongue.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I will have a flutter if you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said
Philip anxiously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll buy you two hundred and fifty shares and if I see
a half-crown rise I&rsquo;ll sell them at once.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip quickly reckoned out how much that would amount to, and his mouth
watered; thirty pounds would be a godsend just then, and he thought the fates
owed him something. He told Mildred what he had done when he saw her at
breakfast next morning. She thought him very silly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never knew anyone who made money on the Stock Exchange,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Emil always said, you can&rsquo;t expect to make
money on the Stock Exchange, he said.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip bought an evening paper on his way home and turned at once to the money
columns. He knew nothing about these things and had difficulty in finding the
stock which Macalister had spoken of. He saw they had advanced a quarter. His
heart leaped, and then he felt sick with apprehension in case Macalister had
forgotten or for some reason had not bought. Macalister had promised to
telegraph. Philip could not wait to take a tram home. He jumped into a cab. It
was an unwonted extravagance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is there a telegram for me?&rdquo; he said, as he burst in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mildred.
</p>

<p>
His face fell, and in bitter disappointment he sank heavily into a chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then he didn&rsquo;t buy them for me after all. Curse him,&rdquo; he
added violently. &ldquo;What cruel luck! And I&rsquo;ve been thinking all day
of what I&rsquo;d do with the money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, what were you going to do?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of thinking about that now? Oh, I wanted the money
so badly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She gave a laugh and handed him a telegram.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was only having a joke with you. I opened it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He tore it out of her hands. Macalister had bought him two hundred and fifty
shares and sold them at the half-crown profit he had suggested. The commission
note was to follow next day. For one moment Philip was furious with Mildred for
her cruel jest, but then he could only think of his joy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It makes such a difference to me,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
stand you a new dress if you like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want it badly enough,&rdquo; she answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;m going to do. I&rsquo;m going to be
operated upon at the end of July.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, have you got something the matter with you?&rdquo; she interrupted.
</p>

<p>
It struck her that an illness she did not know might explain what had so much
puzzled her. He flushed, for he hated to refer to his deformity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, but they think they can do something to my foot. I couldn&rsquo;t
spare the time before, but now it doesn&rsquo;t matter so much. I shall start
my dressing in October instead of next month. I shall only be in hospital a few
weeks and then we can go away to the seaside for the rest of the summer.
It&rsquo;ll do us all good, you and the baby and me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s go to Brighton, Philip, I like Brighton, you get such a
nice class of people there.&rdquo; Philip had vaguely thought of some little
fishing village in Cornwall, but as she spoke it occurred to him that Mildred
would be bored to death there.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind where we go as long as I get the sea.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He did not know why, but he had suddenly an irresistible longing for the sea.
He wanted to bathe, and he thought with delight of splashing about in the salt
water. He was a good swimmer, and nothing exhilarated him like a rough sea.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, it will be jolly,&rdquo; he cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be like a honeymoon, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;How much can I have for my new dress, Phil?&rdquo;
</p>

<h2>XCIV</h2>

<p>
Philip asked Mr. Jacobs, the assistant-surgeon for whom he had dressed, to do
the operation. Jacobs accepted with pleasure, since he was interested just then
in neglected talipes and was getting together materials for a paper. He warned
Philip that he could not make his foot like the other, but he thought he could
do a good deal; and though he would always limp he would be able to wear a boot
less unsightly than that which he had been accustomed to. Philip remembered how
he had prayed to a God who was able to remove mountains for him who had faith,
and he smiled bitterly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect a miracle,&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re wise to let me try what I can do. You&rsquo;ll find
a club-foot rather a handicap in practice. The layman is full of fads, and he
doesn&rsquo;t like his doctor to have anything the matter with him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip went into a &lsquo;small ward&rsquo;, which was a room on the landing,
outside each ward, reserved for special cases. He remained there a month, for
the surgeon would not let him go till he could walk; and, bearing the operation
very well, he had a pleasant enough time. Lawson and Athelny came to see him,
and one day Mrs. Athelny brought two of her children; students whom he knew
looked in now and again to have a chat; Mildred came twice a week. Everyone was
very kind to him, and Philip, always surprised when anyone took trouble with
him, was touched and grateful. He enjoyed the relief from care; he need not
worry there about the future, neither whether his money would last out nor
whether he would pass his final examinations; and he could read to his
heart&rsquo;s content. He had not been able to read much of late, since Mildred
disturbed him: she would make an aimless remark when he was trying to
concentrate his attention, and would not be satisfied unless he answered;
whenever he was comfortably settled down with a book she would want something
done and would come to him with a cork she could not draw or a hammer to drive
in a nail.
</p>

<p>
They settled to go to Brighton in August. Philip wanted to take lodgings, but
Mildred said that she would have to do housekeeping, and it would only be a
holiday for her if they went to a boarding-house.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have to see about the food every day at home, I get that sick of it I
want a thorough change.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip agreed, and it happened that Mildred knew of a boarding-house at Kemp
Town where they would not be charged more than twenty-five shillings a week
each. She arranged with Philip to write about rooms, but when he got back to
Kennington he found that she had done nothing. He was irritated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought you had so much to do as all that,&rdquo;
he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t think of everything. It&rsquo;s not my fault if I
forget, is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was so anxious to get to the sea that he would not wait to communicate
with the mistress of the boarding-house.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave the luggage at the station and go to the house and see
if they&rsquo;ve got rooms, and if they have we can just send an outside porter
for our traps.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can please yourself,&rdquo; said Mildred stiffly.
</p>

<p>
She did not like being reproached, and, retiring huffily into a haughty
silence, she sat by listlessly while Philip made the preparations for their
departure. The little flat was hot and stuffy under the August sun, and from
the road beat up a malodorous sultriness. As he lay in his bed in the small
ward with its red, distempered walls he had longed for fresh air and the
splashing of the sea against his breast. He felt he would go mad if he had to
spend another night in London. Mildred recovered her good temper when she saw
the streets of Brighton crowded with people making holiday, and they were both
in high spirits as they drove out to Kemp Town. Philip stroked the baby&rsquo;s
cheek.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We shall get a very different colour into them when we&rsquo;ve been
down here a few days,&rdquo; he said, smiling.
</p>

<p>
They arrived at the boarding-house and dismissed the cab. An untidy maid opened
the door and, when Philip asked if they had rooms, said she would inquire. She
fetched her mistress. A middle-aged woman, stout and business-like, came
downstairs, gave them the scrutinising glance of her profession, and asked what
accommodation they required.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Two single rooms, and if you&rsquo;ve got such a thing we&rsquo;d rather
like a cot in one of them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I haven&rsquo;t got that. I&rsquo;ve got one nice large
double room, and I could let you have a cot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that would do,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I could give you another room next week. Brighton&rsquo;s very full just
now, and people have to take what they can get.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If it were only for a few days, Philip, I think we might be able to
manage,&rdquo; said Mildred.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think two rooms would be more convenient. Can you recommend any other
place where they take boarders?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can, but I don&rsquo;t suppose they&rsquo;d have room any more than I
have.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps you wouldn&rsquo;t mind giving me the address.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The house the stout woman suggested was in the next street, and they walked
towards it. Philip could walk quite well, though he had to lean on a stick, and
he was rather weak. Mildred carried the baby. They went for a little in
silence, and then he saw she was crying. It annoyed him, and he took no notice,
but she forced his attention.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lend me a hanky, will you? I can&rsquo;t get at mine with baby,&rdquo;
she said in a voice strangled with sobs, turning her head away from him.
</p>

<p>
He gave her his handkerchief, but said nothing. She dried her eyes, and as he
did not speak, went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I might be poisonous.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t make a scene in the street,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll look so funny insisting on separate rooms like that.
What&rsquo;ll they think of us?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If they knew the circumstances I imagine they&rsquo;d think us
surprisingly moral,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
She gave him a sidelong glance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to give it away that we&rsquo;re not
married?&rdquo; she asked quickly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you live with me as if we were married then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear, I can&rsquo;t explain. I don&rsquo;t want to humiliate you, but
I simply can&rsquo;t. I daresay it&rsquo;s very silly and unreasonable, but
it&rsquo;s stronger than I am. I loved you so much that now…&rdquo; he broke
off. &ldquo;After all, there&rsquo;s no accounting for that sort of
thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A fat lot you must have loved me!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
The boarding-house to which they had been directed was kept by a bustling
maiden lady, with shrewd eyes and voluble speech. They could have one double
room for twenty-five shillings a week each, and five shillings extra for the
baby, or they could have two single rooms for a pound a week more.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have to charge that much more,&rdquo; the woman explained
apologetically, &ldquo;because if I&rsquo;m pushed to it I can put two beds
even in the single rooms.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I daresay that won&rsquo;t ruin us. What do you think, Mildred?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind. Anything&rsquo;s good enough for me,&rdquo; she
answered.
</p>

<p>
Philip passed off her sulky reply with a laugh, and, the landlady having
arranged to send for their luggage, they sat down to rest themselves.
Philip&rsquo;s foot was hurting him a little, and he was glad to put it up on a
chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you don&rsquo;t mind my sitting in the same room with
you,&rdquo; said Mildred aggressively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s quarrel, Mildred,&rdquo; he said gently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you was so well off you could afford to throw away a
pound a week.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry with me. I assure you it&rsquo;s the only way we
can live together at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you despise me, that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t. Why should I?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so unnatural.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it? You&rsquo;re not in love with me, are you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Me? Who d&rsquo;you take me for?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not as if you were a very passionate woman, you&rsquo;re not
that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so humiliating,&rdquo; she said sulkily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t fuss about that if I were you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There were about a dozen people in the boarding-house. They ate in a narrow,
dark room at a long table, at the head of which the landlady sat and carved.
The food was bad. The landlady called it French cooking, by which she meant
that the poor quality of the materials was disguised by ill-made sauces: plaice
masqueraded as sole and New Zealand mutton as lamb. The kitchen was small and
inconvenient, so that everything was served up lukewarm. The people were dull
and pretentious; old ladies with elderly maiden daughters; funny old bachelors
with mincing ways; pale-faced, middle-aged clerks with wives, who talked of
their married daughters and their sons who were in a very good position in the
Colonies. At table they discussed Miss Corelli&rsquo;s latest novel; some of
them liked Lord Leighton better than Mr. Alma-Tadema, and some of them liked
Mr. Alma-Tadema better than Lord Leighton. Mildred soon told the ladies of her
romantic marriage with Philip; and he found himself an object of interest
because his family, county people in a very good position, had cut him off with
a shilling because he married while he was only a stoodent; and Mildred&rsquo;s
father, who had a large place down Devonshire way, wouldn&rsquo;t do anything
for them because she had married Philip. That was why they had come to a
boarding-house and had not a nurse for the baby; but they had to have two rooms
because they were both used to a good deal of accommodation and they
didn&rsquo;t care to be cramped. The other visitors also had explanations of
their presence: one of the single gentlemen generally went to the Metropole for
his holiday, but he liked cheerful company and you couldn&rsquo;t get that at
one of those expensive hotels; and the old lady with the middle-aged daughter
was having her beautiful house in London done up and she said to her daughter:
&ldquo;Gwennie, my dear, we must have a cheap holiday this year,&rdquo; and so
they had come there, though of course it wasn&rsquo;t at all the kind of thing
they were used to. Mildred found them all very superior, and she hated a lot of
common, rough people. She liked gentlemen to be gentlemen in every sense of the
word.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When people are gentlemen and ladies,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I like
them to be gentlemen and ladies.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The remark seemed cryptic to Philip, but when he heard her say it two or three
times to different persons, and found that it aroused hearty agreement, he came
to the conclusion that it was only obscure to his own intelligence. It was the
first time that Philip and Mildred had been thrown entirely together. In London
he did not see her all day, and when he came home the household affairs, the
baby, the neighbours, gave them something to talk about till he settled down to
work. Now he spent the whole day with her. After breakfast they went down to
the beach; the morning went easily enough with a bathe and a stroll along the
front; the evening, which they spent on the pier, having put the baby to bed,
was tolerable, for there was music to listen to and a constant stream of people
to look at; (Philip amused himself by imagining who they were and weaving
little stories about them; he had got into the habit of answering
Mildred&rsquo;s remarks with his mouth only so that his thoughts remained
undisturbed;) but the afternoons were long and dreary. They sat on the beach.
Mildred said they must get all the benefit they could out of Doctor Brighton,
and he could not read because Mildred made observations frequently about things
in general. If he paid no attention she complained.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, leave that silly old book alone. It can&rsquo;t be good for you
always reading. You&rsquo;ll addle your brain, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll
do, Philip.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, rot!&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Besides, it&rsquo;s so unsociable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He discovered that it was difficult to talk to her. She had not even the power
of attending to what she was herself saying, so that a dog running in front of
her or the passing of a man in a loud blazer would call forth a remark and then
she would forget what she had been speaking of. She had a bad memory for names,
and it irritated her not to be able to think of them, so that she would pause
in the middle of some story to rack her brains. Sometimes she had to give it
up, but it often occurred to her afterwards, and when Philip was talking of
something she would interrupt him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Collins, that was it. I knew it would come back to me some time.
Collins, that&rsquo;s the name I couldn&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It exasperated him because it showed that she was not listening to anything he
said, and yet, if he was silent, she reproached him for sulkiness. Her mind was
of an order that could not deal for five minutes with the abstract, and when
Philip gave way to his taste for generalising she very quickly showed that she
was bored. Mildred dreamt a great deal, and she had an accurate memory for her
dreams, which she would relate every day with prolixity.
</p>

<p>
One morning he received a long letter from Thorpe Athelny. He was taking his
holiday in the theatrical way, in which there was much sound sense, which
characterised him. He had done the same thing for ten years. He took his whole
family to a hop-field in Kent, not far from Mrs. Athelny&rsquo;s home, and they
spent three weeks hopping. It kept them in the open air, earned them money,
much to Mrs. Athelny&rsquo;s satisfaction, and renewed their contact with
mother earth. It was upon this that Athelny laid stress. The sojourn in the
fields gave them a new strength; it was like a magic ceremony, by which they
renewed their youth and the power of their limbs and the sweetness of the
spirit: Philip had heard him say many fantastic, rhetorical, and picturesque
things on the subject. Now Athelny invited him to come over for a day, he had
certain meditations on Shakespeare and the musical glasses which he desired to
impart, and the children were clamouring for a sight of Uncle Philip. Philip
read the letter again in the afternoon when he was sitting with Mildred on the
beach. He thought of Mrs. Athelny, cheerful mother of many children, with her
kindly hospitality and her good humour; of Sally, grave for her years, with
funny little maternal ways and an air of authority, with her long plait of fair
hair and her broad forehead; and then in a bunch of all the others, merry,
boisterous, healthy, and handsome. His heart went out to them. There was one
quality which they had that he did not remember to have noticed in people
before, and that was goodness. It had not occurred to him till now, but it was
evidently the beauty of their goodness which attracted him. In theory he did
not believe in it: if morality were no more than a matter of convenience good
and evil had no meaning. He did not like to be illogical, but here was simple
goodness, natural and without effort, and he thought it beautiful. Meditating,
he slowly tore the letter into little pieces; he did not see how he could go
without Mildred, and he did not want to go with her.
</p>

<p>
It was very hot, the sky was cloudless, and they had been driven to a shady
corner. The baby was gravely playing with stones on the beach, and now and then
she crawled up to Philip and gave him one to hold, then took it away again and
placed it carefully down. She was playing a mysterious and complicated game
known only to herself. Mildred was asleep. She lay with her head thrown back
and her mouth slightly open; her legs were stretched out, and her boots
protruded from her petticoats in a grotesque fashion. His eyes had been resting
on her vaguely, but now he looked at her with peculiar attention. He remembered
how passionately he had loved her, and he wondered why now he was entirely
indifferent to her. The change in him filled him with dull pain. It seemed to
him that all he had suffered had been sheer waste. The touch of her hand had
filled him with ecstasy; he had desired to enter into her soul so that he could
share every thought with her and every feeling; he had suffered acutely
because, when silence had fallen between them, a remark of hers showed how far
their thoughts had travelled apart, and he had rebelled against the
unsurmountable wall which seemed to divide every personality from every other.
He found it strangely tragic that he had loved her so madly and now loved her
not at all. Sometimes he hated her. She was incapable of learning, and the
experience of life had taught her nothing. She was as unmannerly as she had
always been. It revolted Philip to hear the insolence with which she treated
the hard-worked servant at the boarding-house.
</p>

<p>
Presently he considered his own plans. At the end of his fourth year he would
be able to take his examination in midwifery, and a year more would see him
qualified. Then he might manage a journey to Spain. He wanted to see the
pictures which he knew only from photographs; he felt deeply that El Greco held
a secret of peculiar moment to him; and he fancied that in Toledo he would
surely find it out. He did not wish to do things grandly, and on a hundred
pounds he might live for six months in Spain: if Macalister put him on to
another good thing he could make that easily. His heart warmed at the thought
of those old beautiful cities, and the tawny plains of Castile. He was
convinced that more might be got out of life than offered itself at present,
and he thought that in Spain he could live with greater intensity: it might be
possible to practise in one of those old cities, there were a good many
foreigners, passing or resident, and he should be able to pick up a living. But
that would be much later; first he must get one or two hospital appointments;
they gave experience and made it easy to get jobs afterwards. He wished to get
a berth as ship&rsquo;s doctor on one of the large tramps that took things
leisurely enough for a man to see something of the places at which they
stopped. He wanted to go to the East; and his fancy was rich with pictures of
Bangkok and Shanghai, and the ports of Japan: he pictured to himself palm-trees
and skies blue and hot, dark-skinned people, pagodas; the scents of the Orient
intoxicated his nostrils. His heart beat with passionate desire for the beauty
and the strangeness of the world.
</p>

<p>
Mildred awoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do believe I&rsquo;ve been asleep,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Now then,
you naughty girl, what have you been doing to yourself? Her dress was clean
yesterday and just look at it now, Philip.&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>XCV</h2>

<p>
When they returned to London Philip began his dressing in the surgical wards.
He was not so much interested in surgery as in medicine, which, a more
empirical science, offered greater scope to the imagination. The work was a
little harder than the corresponding work on the medical side. There was a
lecture from nine till ten, when he went into the wards; there wounds had to be
dressed, stitches taken out, bandages renewed: Philip prided himself a little
on his skill in bandaging, and it amused him to wring a word of approval from a
nurse. On certain afternoons in the week there were operations; and he stood in
the well of the theatre, in a white jacket, ready to hand the operating surgeon
any instrument he wanted or to sponge the blood away so that he could see what
he was about. When some rare operation was to be performed the theatre would
fill up, but generally there were not more than half a dozen students present,
and then the proceedings had a cosiness which Philip enjoyed. At that time the
world at large seemed to have a passion for appendicitis, and a good many cases
came to the operating theatre for this complaint: the surgeon for whom Philip
dressed was in friendly rivalry with a colleague as to which could remove an
appendix in the shortest time and with the smallest incision.
</p>

<p>
In due course Philip was put on accident duty. The dressers took this in turn;
it lasted three days, during which they lived in hospital and ate their meals
in the common-room; they had a room on the ground floor near the casualty ward,
with a bed that shut up during the day into a cupboard. The dresser on duty had
to be at hand day and night to see to any casualty that came in. You were on
the move all the time, and not more than an hour or two passed during the night
without the clanging of the bell just above your head which made you leap out
of bed instinctively. Saturday night was of course the busiest time and the
closing of the public-houses the busiest hour. Men would be brought in by the
police dead drunk and it would be necessary to administer a stomach-pump;
women, rather the worse for liquor themselves, would come in with a wound on
the head or a bleeding nose which their husbands had given them: some would vow
to have the law on him, and others, ashamed, would declare that it had been an
accident. What the dresser could manage himself he did, but if there was
anything important he sent for the house-surgeon: he did this with care, since
the house-surgeon was not vastly pleased to be dragged down five flights of
stairs for nothing. The cases ranged from a cut finger to a cut throat. Boys
came in with hands mangled by some machine, men were brought who had been
knocked down by a cab, and children who had broken a limb while playing: now
and then attempted suicides were carried in by the police: Philip saw a
ghastly, wild-eyed man with a great gash from ear to ear, and he was in the
ward for weeks afterwards in charge of a constable, silent, angry because he
was alive, and sullen; he made no secret of the fact that he would try again to
kill himself as soon as he was released. The wards were crowded, and the
house-surgeon was faced with a dilemma when patients were brought in by the
police: if they were sent on to the station and died there disagreeable things
were said in the papers; and it was very difficult sometimes to tell if a man
was dying or drunk. Philip did not go to bed till he was tired out, so that he
should not have the bother of getting up again in an hour; and he sat in the
casualty ward talking in the intervals of work with the night-nurse. She was a
gray-haired woman of masculine appearance, who had been night-nurse in the
casualty department for twenty years. She liked the work because she was her
own mistress and had no sister to bother her. Her movements were slow, but she
was immensely capable and she never failed in an emergency. The dressers, often
inexperienced or nervous, found her a tower of strength. She had seen thousands
of them, and they made no impression upon her: she always called them Mr.
Brown; and when they expostulated and told her their real names, she merely
nodded and went on calling them Mr. Brown. It interested Philip to sit with her
in the bare room, with its two horse-hair couches and the flaring gas, and
listen to her. She had long ceased to look upon the people who came in as human
beings; they were drunks, or broken arms, or cut throats. She took the vice and
misery and cruelty of the world as a matter of course; she found nothing to
praise or blame in human actions: she accepted. She had a certain grim humour.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I remember one suicide,&rdquo; she said to Philip, &ldquo;who threw
himself into the Thames. They fished him out and brought him here, and ten days
later he developed typhoid fever from swallowing Thames water.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did he die?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, he did all right. I could never make up my mind if it was suicide
or not…. They&rsquo;re a funny lot, suicides. I remember one man who
couldn&rsquo;t get any work to do and his wife died, so he pawned his clothes
and bought a revolver; but he made a mess of it, he only shot out an eye and he
got all right. And then, if you please, with an eye gone and a piece of his
face blow away, he came to the conclusion that the world wasn&rsquo;t such a
bad place after all, and he lived happily ever afterwards. Thing I&rsquo;ve
always noticed, people don&rsquo;t commit suicide for love, as you&rsquo;d
expect, that&rsquo;s just a fancy of novelists; they commit suicide because
they haven&rsquo;t got any money. I wonder why that is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose money&rsquo;s more important than love,&rdquo; suggested
Philip.
</p>

<p>
Money was in any case occupying Philip&rsquo;s thoughts a good deal just then.
He discovered the little truth there was in the airy saying which himself had
repeated, that two could live as cheaply as one, and his expenses were
beginning to worry him. Mildred was not a good manager, and it cost them as
much to live as if they had eaten in restaurants; the child needed clothes, and
Mildred boots, an umbrella, and other small things which it was impossible for
her to do without. When they returned from Brighton she had announced her
intention of getting a job, but she took no definite steps, and presently a bad
cold laid her up for a fortnight. When she was well she answered one or two
advertisements, but nothing came of it: either she arrived too late and the
vacant place was filled, or the work was more than she felt strong enough to
do. Once she got an offer, but the wages were only fourteen shillings a week,
and she thought she was worth more than that.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good letting oneself be put upon,&rdquo; she remarked.
&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t respect you if you let yourself go too cheap.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think fourteen shillings is so bad,&rdquo; answered
Philip, drily.
</p>

<p>
He could not help thinking how useful it would be towards the expenses of the
household, and Mildred was already beginning to hint that she did not get a
place because she had not got a decent dress to interview employers in. He gave
her the dress, and she made one or two more attempts, but Philip came to the
conclusion that they were not serious. She did not want to work. The only way
he knew to make money was on the Stock Exchange, and he was very anxious to
repeat the lucky experiment of the summer; but war had broken out with the
Transvaal and nothing was doing in South Africans. Macalister told him that
Redvers Buller would march into Pretoria in a month and then everything would
boom. The only thing was to wait patiently. What they wanted was a British
reverse to knock things down a bit, and then it might be worth while buying.
Philip began reading assiduously the &lsquo;city chat&rsquo; of his favourite
newspaper. He was worried and irritable. Once or twice he spoke sharply to
Mildred, and since she was neither tactful nor patient she answered with
temper, and they quarrelled. Philip always expressed his regret for what he had
said, but Mildred had not a forgiving nature, and she would sulk for a couple
of days. She got on his nerves in all sorts of ways; by the manner in which she
ate, and by the untidiness which made her leave articles of clothing about
their sitting-room: Philip was excited by the war and devoured the papers,
morning and evening; but she took no interest in anything that happened. She
had made the acquaintance of two or three people who lived in the street, and
one of them had asked if she would like the curate to call on her. She wore a
wedding-ring and called herself Mrs. Carey. On Philip&rsquo;s walls were two or
three of the drawings which he had made in Paris, nudes, two of women and one
of Miguel Ajuria, standing very square on his feet, with clenched fists. Philip
kept them because they were the best things he had done, and they reminded him
of happy days. Mildred had long looked at them with disfavour.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d take those drawings down, Philip,&rdquo; she said to
him at last. &ldquo;Mrs. Foreman, of number thirteen, came in yesterday
afternoon, and I didn&rsquo;t know which way to look. I saw her staring at
them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re indecent. Disgusting, that&rsquo;s what I call it, to have
drawings of naked people about. And it isn&rsquo;t nice for baby either.
She&rsquo;s beginning to notice things now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can you be so vulgar?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Vulgar? Modest, I call it. I&rsquo;ve never said anything, but
d&rsquo;you think I like having to look at those naked people all day
long.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you no sense of humour at all, Mildred?&rdquo; he asked frigidly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what sense of humour&rsquo;s got to do with it.
I&rsquo;ve got a good mind to take them down myself. If you want to know what I
think about them, I think they&rsquo;re disgusting.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know what you think about them, and I forbid you
to touch them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When Mildred was cross with him she punished him through the baby. The little
girl was as fond of Philip as he was of her, and it was her great pleasure
every morning to crawl into his room (she was getting on for two now and could
walk pretty well), and be taken up into his bed. When Mildred stopped this the
poor child would cry bitterly. To Philip&rsquo;s remonstrances she replied:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want her to get into habits.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And if then he said anything more she said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing to do with you what I do with my child. To hear you
talk one would think you was her father. I&rsquo;m her mother, and I ought to
know what&rsquo;s good for her, oughtn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was exasperated by Mildred&rsquo;s stupidity; but he was so indifferent
to her now that it was only at times she made him angry. He grew used to having
her about. Christmas came, and with it a couple of days holiday for Philip. He
brought some holly in and decorated the flat, and on Christmas Day he gave
small presents to Mildred and the baby. There were only two of them so they
could not have a turkey, but Mildred roasted a chicken and boiled a Christmas
pudding which she had bought at a local grocer&rsquo;s. They stood themselves a
bottle of wine. When they had dined Philip sat in his arm-chair by the fire,
smoking his pipe; and the unaccustomed wine had made him forget for a while the
anxiety about money which was so constantly with him. He felt happy and
comfortable. Presently Mildred came in to tell him that the baby wanted him to
kiss her good-night, and with a smile he went into Mildred&rsquo;s bed-room.
Then, telling the child to go to sleep, he turned down the gas and, leaving the
door open in case she cried, went back into the sitting-room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where are you going to sit?&rdquo; he asked Mildred.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You sit in your chair. I&rsquo;m going to sit on the floor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When he sat down she settled herself in front of the fire and leaned against
his knees. He could not help remembering that this was how they had sat
together in her rooms in the Vauxhall Bridge Road, but the positions had been
reversed; it was he who had sat on the floor and leaned his head against her
knee. How passionately he had loved her then! Now he felt for her a tenderness
he had not known for a long time. He seemed still to feel twined round his neck
the baby&rsquo;s soft little arms.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you comfy?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
She looked up at him, gave a slight smile, and nodded. They gazed into the fire
dreamily, without speaking to one another. At last she turned round and stared
at him curiously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you know that you haven&rsquo;t kissed me once since I came
here?&rdquo; she said suddenly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you want me to?&rdquo; he smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you don&rsquo;t care for me in that way any more?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very fond of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re much fonder of baby.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He did not answer, and she laid her cheek against his hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not angry with me any more?&rdquo; she asked presently,
with her eyes cast down.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why on earth should I be?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never cared for you as I do now. It&rsquo;s only since I
passed through the fire that I&rsquo;ve learnt to love you.&rdquo; It chilled
Philip to hear her make use of the sort of phrase she read in the penny
novelettes which she devoured. Then he wondered whether what she said had any
meaning for her: perhaps she knew no other way to express her genuine feelings
than the stilted language of The Family Herald.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It seems so funny our living together like this.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He did not reply for quite a long time, and silence fell upon them again; but
at last he spoke and seemed conscious of no interval.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t be angry with me. One can&rsquo;t help these things. I
remember that I thought you wicked and cruel because you did this, that, and
the other; but it was very silly of me. You didn&rsquo;t love me, and it was
absurd to blame you for that. I thought I could make you love me, but I know
now that was impossible. I don&rsquo;t know what it is that makes someone love
you, but whatever it is, it&rsquo;s the only thing that matters, and if it
isn&rsquo;t there you won&rsquo;t create it by kindness, or generosity, or
anything of that sort.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should have thought if you&rsquo;d loved me really you&rsquo;d have
loved me still.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should have thought so too. I remember how I used to think that it
would last for ever, I felt I would rather die than be without you, and I used
to long for the time when you would be faded and wrinkled so that nobody cared
for you any more and I should have you all to myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She did not answer, and presently she got up and said she was going to bed. She
gave a timid little smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Christmas Day, Philip, won&rsquo;t you kiss me
good-night?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He gave a laugh, blushed slightly, and kissed her. She went to her bed-room and
he began to read.
</p>

<h2>XCVI</h2>

<p>
The climax came two or three weeks later. Mildred was driven by Philip&rsquo;s
behaviour to a pitch of strange exasperation. There were many different
emotions in her soul, and she passed from mood to mood with facility. She spent
a great deal of time alone and brooded over her position. She did not put all
her feelings into words, she did not even know what they were, but certain
things stood out in her mind, and she thought of them over and over again. She
had never understood Philip, nor had very much liked him; but she was pleased
to have him about her because she thought he was a gentleman. She was impressed
because his father had been a doctor and his uncle was a clergyman. She
despised him a little because she had made such a fool of him, and at the same
time was never quite comfortable in his presence; she could not let herself go,
and she felt that he was criticising her manners.
</p>

<p>
When she first came to live in the little rooms in Kennington she was tired out
and ashamed. She was glad to be left alone. It was a comfort to think that
there was no rent to pay; she need not go out in all weathers, and she could
lie quietly in bed if she did not feel well. She had hated the life she led. It
was horrible to have to be affable and subservient; and even now when it
crossed her mind she cried with pity for herself as she thought of the
roughness of men and their brutal language. But it crossed her mind very
seldom. She was grateful to Philip for coming to her rescue, and when she
remembered how honestly he had loved her and how badly she had treated him, she
felt a pang of remorse. It was easy to make it up to him. It meant very little
to her. She was surprised when he refused her suggestion, but she shrugged her
shoulders: let him put on airs if he liked, she did not care, he would be
anxious enough in a little while, and then it would be her turn to refuse; if
he thought it was any deprivation to her he was very much mistaken. She had no
doubt of her power over him. He was peculiar, but she knew him through and
through. He had so often quarrelled with her and sworn he would never see her
again, and then in a little while he had come on his knees begging to be
forgiven. It gave her a thrill to think how he had cringed before her. He would
have been glad to lie down on the ground for her to walk on him. She had seen
him cry. She knew exactly how to treat him, pay no attention to him, just
pretend you didn&rsquo;t notice his tempers, leave him severely alone, and in a
little while he was sure to grovel. She laughed a little to herself,
good-humouredly, when she thought how he had come and eaten dirt before her.
She had had her fling now. She knew what men were and did not want to have
anything more to do with them. She was quite ready to settle down with Philip.
When all was said, he was a gentleman in every sense of the word, and that was
something not to be sneezed at, wasn&rsquo;t it? Anyhow she was in no hurry,
and she was not going to take the first step. She was glad to see how fond he
was growing of the baby, though it tickled her a good deal; it was comic that
he should set so much store on another man&rsquo;s child. He was peculiar and
no mistake.
</p>

<p>
But one or two things surprised her. She had been used to his subservience: he
was only too glad to do anything for her in the old days, she was accustomed to
see him cast down by a cross word and in ecstasy at a kind one; he was
different now, and she said to herself that he had not improved in the last
year. It never struck her for a moment that there could be any change in his
feelings, and she thought it was only acting when he paid no heed to her bad
temper. He wanted to read sometimes and told her to stop talking: she did not
know whether to flare up or to sulk, and was so puzzled that she did neither.
Then came the conversation in which he told her that he intended their
relations to be platonic, and, remembering an incident of their common past, it
occurred to her that he dreaded the possibility of her being pregnant. She took
pains to reassure him. It made no difference. She was the sort of woman who was
unable to realise that a man might not have her own obsession with sex; her
relations with men had been purely on those lines; and she could not understand
that they ever had other interests. The thought struck her that Philip was in
love with somebody else, and she watched him, suspecting nurses at the hospital
or people he met out; but artful questions led her to the conclusion that there
was no one dangerous in the Athelny household; and it forced itself upon her
also that Philip, like most medical students, was unconscious of the sex of the
nurses with whom his work threw him in contact. They were associated in his
mind with a faint odour of iodoform. Philip received no letters, and there was
no girl&rsquo;s photograph among his belongings. If he was in love with
someone, he was very clever at hiding it; and he answered all Mildred&rsquo;s
questions with frankness and apparently without suspicion that there was any
motive in them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s in love with anybody else,&rdquo; she
said to herself at last.
</p>

<p>
It was a relief, for in that case he was certainly still in love with her; but
it made his behaviour very puzzling. If he was going to treat her like that why
did he ask her to come and live at the flat? It was unnatural. Mildred was not
a woman who conceived the possibility of compassion, generosity, or kindness.
Her only conclusion was that Philip was queer. She took it into her head that
the reasons for his conduct were chivalrous; and, her imagination filled with
the extravagances of cheap fiction, she pictured to herself all sorts of
romantic explanations for his delicacy. Her fancy ran riot with bitter
misunderstandings, purifications by fire, snow-white souls, and death in the
cruel cold of a Christmas night. She made up her mind that when they went to
Brighton she would put an end to all his nonsense; they would be alone there,
everyone would think them husband and wife, and there would be the pier and the
band. When she found that nothing would induce Philip to share the same room
with her, when he spoke to her about it with a tone in his voice she had never
heard before, she suddenly realised that he did not want her. She was
astounded. She remembered all he had said in the past and how desperately he
had loved her. She felt humiliated and angry, but she had a sort of native
insolence which carried her through. He needn&rsquo;t think she was in love
with him, because she wasn&rsquo;t. She hated him sometimes, and she longed to
humble him; but she found herself singularly powerless; she did not know which
way to handle him. She began to be a little nervous with him. Once or twice she
cried. Once or twice she set herself to be particularly nice to him; but when
she took his arm while they walked along the front at night he made some excuse
in a while to release himself, as though it were unpleasant for him to be
touched by her. She could not make it out. The only hold she had over him was
through the baby, of whom he seemed to grow fonder and fonder: she could make
him white with anger by giving the child a slap or a push; and the only time
the old, tender smile came back into his eyes was when she stood with the baby
in her arms. She noticed it when she was being photographed like that by a man
on the beach, and afterwards she often stood in the same way for Philip to look
at her.
</p>

<p>
When they got back to London Mildred began looking for the work she had
asserted was so easy to find; she wanted now to be independent of Philip; and
she thought of the satisfaction with which she would announce to him that she
was going into rooms and would take the child with her. But her heart failed
her when she came into closer contact with the possibility. She had grown
unused to the long hours, she did not want to be at the beck and call of a
manageress, and her dignity revolted at the thought of wearing once more a
uniform. She had made out to such of the neighbours as she knew that they were
comfortably off: it would be a come-down if they heard that she had to go out
and work. Her natural indolence asserted itself. She did not want to leave
Philip, and so long as he was willing to provide for her, she did not see why
she should. There was no money to throw away, but she got her board and
lodging, and he might get better off. His uncle was an old man and might die
any day, he would come into a little then, and even as things were, it was
better than slaving from morning till night for a few shillings a week. Her
efforts relaxed; she kept on reading the advertisement columns of the daily
paper merely to show that she wanted to do something if anything that was worth
her while presented itself. But panic seized her, and she was afraid that
Philip would grow tired of supporting her. She had no hold over him at all now,
and she fancied that he only allowed her to stay there because he was fond of
the baby. She brooded over it all, and she thought to herself angrily that she
would make him pay for all this some day. She could not reconcile herself to
the fact that he no longer cared for her. She would make him. She suffered from
pique, and sometimes in a curious fashion she desired Philip. He was so cold
now that it exasperated her. She thought of him in that way incessantly. She
thought that he was treating her very badly, and she did not know what she had
done to deserve it. She kept on saying to herself that it was unnatural they
should live like that. Then she thought that if things were different and she
were going to have a baby, he would be sure to marry her. He was funny, but he
was a gentleman in every sense of the word, no one could deny that. At last it
became an obsession with her, and she made up her mind to force a change in
their relations. He never even kissed her now, and she wanted him to: she
remembered how ardently he had been used to press her lips. It gave her a
curious feeling to think of it. She often looked at his mouth.
</p>

<p>
One evening, at the beginning of February, Philip told her that he was dining
with Lawson, who was giving a party in his studio to celebrate his birthday;
and he would not be in till late; Lawson had bought a couple of bottles of the
punch they favoured from the tavern in Beak Street, and they proposed to have a
merry evening. Mildred asked if there were going to be women there, but Philip
told her there were not; only men had been invited; and they were just going to
sit and talk and smoke: Mildred did not think it sounded very amusing; if she
were a painter she would have half a dozen models about. She went to bed, but
could not sleep, and presently an idea struck her; she got up and fixed the
catch on the wicket at the landing, so that Philip could not get in. He came
back about one, and she heard him curse when he found that the wicket was
closed. She got out of bed and opened.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why on earth did you shut yourself in? I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;ve
dragged you out of bed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I left it open on purpose, I can&rsquo;t think how it came to be
shut.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hurry up and get back to bed, or you&rsquo;ll catch cold.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He walked into the sitting-room and turned up the gas. She followed him in. She
went up to the fire.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want to warm my feet a bit. They&rsquo;re like ice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He sat down and began to take off his boots. His eyes were shining and his
cheeks were flushed. She thought he had been drinking.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you been enjoying yourself?&rdquo; she asked, with a smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve had a ripping time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was quite sober, but he had been talking and laughing, and he was
excited still. An evening of that sort reminded him of the old days in Paris.
He was in high spirits. He took his pipe out of his pocket and filled it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to bed?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not yet, I&rsquo;m not a bit sleepy. Lawson was in great form. He talked
sixteen to the dozen from the moment I got there till the moment I left.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did you talk about?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Heaven knows! Of every subject under the sun. You should have seen us
all shouting at the tops of our voices and nobody listening.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip laughed with pleasure at the recollection, and Mildred laughed too. She
was pretty sure he had drunk more than was good for him. That was exactly what
she had expected. She knew men.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can I sit down?&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
Before he could answer she settled herself on his knees.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not going to bed you&rsquo;d better go and put on a
dressing-gown.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all right as I am.&rdquo; Then putting her arms round his
neck, she placed her face against his and said: &ldquo;Why are you so horrid to
me, Phil?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He tried to get up, but she would not let him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do love you, Philip,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk damned rot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s true. I can&rsquo;t live without you. I want
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He released himself from her arms.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Please get up. You&rsquo;re making a fool of yourself and you&rsquo;re
making me feel a perfect idiot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I love you, Philip. I want to make up for all the harm I did you. I
can&rsquo;t go on like this, it&rsquo;s not in human nature.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He slipped out of the chair and left her in it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry, but it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She gave a heart-rending sob.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But why? How can you be so cruel?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s because I loved you too much. I wore the passion
out. The thought of anything of that sort horrifies me. I can&rsquo;t look at
you now without thinking of Emil and Griffiths. One can&rsquo;t help those
things, I suppose it&rsquo;s just nerves.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She seized his hand and covered it with kisses.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he cried.
</p>

<p>
She sank back into the chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go on like this. If you won&rsquo;t love me, I&rsquo;d
rather go away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish, you haven&rsquo;t anywhere to go. You can stay
here as long as you like, but it must be on the definite understanding that
we&rsquo;re friends and nothing more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then she dropped suddenly the vehemence of passion and gave a soft, insinuating
laugh. She sidled up to Philip and put her arms round him. She made her voice
low and wheedling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be such an old silly. I believe you&rsquo;re nervous. You
don&rsquo;t know how nice I can be.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She put her face against his and rubbed his cheek with hers. To Philip her
smile was an abominable leer, and the suggestive glitter of her eyes filled him
with horror. He drew back instinctively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
But she would not let him go. She sought his mouth with her lips. He took her
hands and tore them roughly apart and pushed her away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You disgust me,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She steadied herself with one hand on the chimney-piece. She looked at him for
an instant, and two red spots suddenly appeared on her cheeks. She gave a
shrill, angry laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I disgust YOU.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She paused and drew in her breath sharply. Then she burst into a furious
torrent of abuse. She shouted at the top of her voice. She called him every
foul name she could think of. She used language so obscene that Philip was
astounded; she was always so anxious to be refined, so shocked by coarseness,
that it had never occurred to him that she knew the words she used now. She
came up to him and thrust her face in his. It was distorted with passion, and
in her tumultuous speech the spittle dribbled over her lips.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never cared for you, not once, I was making a fool of you always, you
bored me, you bored me stiff, and I hated you, I would never have let you touch
me only for the money, and it used to make me sick when I had to let you kiss
me. We laughed at you, Griffiths and me, we laughed because you was such a mug.
A mug! A mug!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then she burst again into abominable invective. She accused him of every mean
fault; she said he was stingy, she said he was dull, she said he was vain,
selfish; she cast virulent ridicule on everything upon which he was most
sensitive. And at last she turned to go. She kept on, with hysterical violence,
shouting at him an opprobrious, filthy epithet. She seized the handle of the
door and flung it open. Then she turned round and hurled at him the injury
which she knew was the only one that really touched him. She threw into the
word all the malice and all the venom of which she was capable. She flung it at
him as though it were a blow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Cripple!&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>XCVII</h2>

<p>
Philip awoke with a start next morning, conscious that it was late, and looking
at his watch found it was nine o&rsquo;clock. He jumped out of bed and went
into the kitchen to get himself some hot water to shave with. There was no sign
of Mildred, and the things which she had used for her supper the night before
still lay in the sink unwashed. He knocked at her door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wake up, Mildred. It&rsquo;s awfully late.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She did not answer, even after a second louder knocking, and he concluded that
she was sulking. He was in too great a hurry to bother about that. He put some
water on to boil and jumped into his bath which was always poured out the night
before in order to take the chill off. He presumed that Mildred would cook his
breakfast while he was dressing and leave it in the sitting-room. She had done
that two or three times when she was out of temper. But he heard no sound of
her moving, and realised that if he wanted anything to eat he would have to get
it himself. He was irritated that she should play him such a trick on a morning
when he had over-slept himself. There was still no sign of her when he was
ready, but he heard her moving about her room. She was evidently getting up. He
made himself some tea and cut himself a couple of pieces of bread and butter,
which he ate while he was putting on his boots, then bolted downstairs and
along the street into the main road to catch his tram. While his eyes sought
out the newspaper shops to see the war news on the placards, he thought of the
scene of the night before: now that it was over and he had slept on it, he
could not help thinking it grotesque; he supposed he had been ridiculous, but
he was not master of his feelings; at the time they had been overwhelming. He
was angry with Mildred because she had forced him into that absurd position,
and then with renewed astonishment he thought of her outburst and the filthy
language she had used. He could not help flushing when he remembered her final
jibe; but he shrugged his shoulders contemptuously. He had long known that when
his fellows were angry with him they never failed to taunt him with his
deformity. He had seen men at the hospital imitate his walk, not before him as
they used at school, but when they thought he was not looking. He knew now that
they did it from no wilful unkindness, but because man is naturally an
imitative animal, and because it was an easy way to make people laugh: he knew
it, but he could never resign himself to it.
</p>

<p>
He was glad to throw himself into his work. The ward seemed pleasant and
friendly when he entered it. The sister greeted him with a quick, business-like
smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very late, Mr. Carey.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was out on the loose last night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You look it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Laughing, he went to the first of his cases, a boy with tuberculous ulcers, and
removed his bandages. The boy was pleased to see him, and Philip chaffed him as
he put a clean dressing on the wound. Philip was a favourite with the patients;
he treated them good-humouredly; and he had gentle, sensitive hands which did
not hurt them: some of the dressers were a little rough and happy-go-lucky in
their methods. He lunched with his friends in the club-room, a frugal meal
consisting of a scone and butter, with a cup of cocoa, and they talked of the
war. Several men were going out, but the authorities were particular and
refused everyone who had not had a hospital appointment. Someone suggested
that, if the war went on, in a while they would be glad to take anyone who was
qualified; but the general opinion was that it would be over in a month. Now
that Roberts was there things would get all right in no time. This was
Macalister&rsquo;s opinion too, and he had told Philip that they must watch
their chance and buy just before peace was declared. There would be a boom
then, and they might all make a bit of money. Philip had left with Macalister
instructions to buy him stock whenever the opportunity presented itself. His
appetite had been whetted by the thirty pounds he had made in the summer, and
he wanted now to make a couple of hundred.
</p>

<p>
He finished his day&rsquo;s work and got on a tram to go back to Kennington. He
wondered how Mildred would behave that evening. It was a nuisance to think that
she would probably be surly and refuse to answer his questions. It was a warm
evening for the time of year, and even in those gray streets of South London
there was the languor of February; nature is restless then after the long
winter months, growing things awake from their sleep, and there is a rustle in
the earth, a forerunner of spring, as it resumes its eternal activities. Philip
would have liked to drive on further, it was distasteful to him to go back to
his rooms, and he wanted the air; but the desire to see the child clutched
suddenly at his heartstrings, and he smiled to himself as he thought of her
toddling towards him with a crow of delight. He was surprised, when he reached
the house and looked up mechanically at the windows, to see that there was no
light. He went upstairs and knocked, but got no answer. When Mildred went out
she left the key under the mat and he found it there now. He let himself in and
going into the sitting-room struck a match. Something had happened, he did not
at once know what; he turned the gas on full and lit it; the room was suddenly
filled with the glare and he looked round. He gasped. The whole place was
wrecked. Everything in it had been wilfully destroyed. Anger seized him, and he
rushed into Mildred&rsquo;s room. It was dark and empty. When he had got a
light he saw that she had taken away all her things and the baby&rsquo;s (he
had noticed on entering that the go-cart was not in its usual place on the
landing, but thought Mildred had taken the baby out;) and all the things on the
washing-stand had been broken, a knife had been drawn cross-ways through the
seats of the two chairs, the pillow had been slit open, there were large gashes
in the sheets and the counterpane, the looking-glass appeared to have been
broken with a hammer. Philip was bewildered. He went into his own room, and
here too everything was in confusion. The basin and the ewer had been smashed,
the looking-glass was in fragments, and the sheets were in ribands. Mildred had
made a slit large enough to put her hand into the pillow and had scattered the
feathers about the room. She had jabbed a knife into the blankets. On the
dressing-table were photographs of Philip&rsquo;s mother, the frames had been
smashed and the glass shivered. Philip went into the tiny kitchen. Everything
that was breakable was broken, glasses, pudding-basins, plates, dishes.
</p>

<p>
It took Philip&rsquo;s breath away. Mildred had left no letter, nothing but
this ruin to mark her anger, and he could imagine the set face with which she
had gone about her work. He went back into the sitting-room and looked about
him. He was so astonished that he no longer felt angry. He looked curiously at
the kitchen-knife and the coal-hammer, which were lying on the table where she
had left them. Then his eye caught a large carving-knife in the fireplace which
had been broken. It must have taken her a long time to do so much damage.
Lawson&rsquo;s portrait of him had been cut cross-ways and gaped hideously. His
own drawings had been ripped in pieces; and the photographs, Manet&rsquo;s
Olympia and the Odalisque of Ingres, the portrait of Philip IV, had been
smashed with great blows of the coal-hammer. There were gashes in the
table-cloth and in the curtains and in the two arm-chairs. They were quite
ruined. On one wall over the table which Philip used as his desk was the little
bit of Persian rug which Cronshaw had given him. Mildred had always hated it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a rug it ought to go on the floor,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and it&rsquo;s a dirty stinking bit of stuff, that&rsquo;s all it
is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It made her furious because Philip told her it contained the answer to a great
riddle. She thought he was making fun of her. She had drawn the knife right
through it three times, it must have required some strength, and it hung now in
tatters. Philip had two or three blue and white plates, of no value, but he had
bought them one by one for very small sums and liked them for their
associations. They littered the floor in fragments. There were long gashes on
the backs of his books, and she had taken the trouble to tear pages out of the
unbound French ones. The little ornaments on the chimney-piece lay on the
hearth in bits. Everything that it had been possible to destroy with a knife or
a hammer was destroyed.
</p>

<p>
The whole of Philip&rsquo;s belongings would not have sold for thirty pounds,
but most of them were old friends, and he was a domestic creature, attached to
all those odds and ends because they were his; he had been proud of his little
home, and on so little money had made it pretty and characteristic. He sank
down now in despair. He asked himself how she could have been so cruel. A
sudden fear got him on his feet again and into the passage, where stood a
cupboard in which he kept his clothes. He opened it and gave a sigh of relief.
She had apparently forgotten it and none of his things was touched.
</p>

<p>
He went back into the sitting-room and, surveying the scene, wondered what to
do; he had not the heart to begin trying to set things straight; besides there
was no food in the house, and he was hungry. He went out and got himself
something to eat. When he came in he was cooler. A little pang seized him as he
thought of the child, and he wondered whether she would miss him, at first
perhaps, but in a week she would have forgotten him; and he was thankful to be
rid of Mildred. He did not think of her with wrath, but with an overwhelming
sense of boredom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope to God I never see her again,&rdquo; he said aloud.
</p>

<p>
The only thing now was to leave the rooms, and he made up his mind to give
notice the next morning. He could not afford to make good the damage done, and
he had so little money left that he must find cheaper lodgings still. He would
be glad to get out of them. The expense had worried him, and now the
recollection of Mildred would be in them always. Philip was impatient and could
never rest till he had put in action the plan which he had in mind; so on the
following afternoon he got in a dealer in second-hand furniture who offered him
three pounds for all his goods damaged and undamaged; and two days later he
moved into the house opposite the hospital in which he had had rooms when first
he became a medical student. The landlady was a very decent woman. He took a
bed-room at the top, which she let him have for six shillings a week; it was
small and shabby and looked on the yard of the house that backed on to it, but
he had nothing now except his clothes and a box of books, and he was glad to
lodge so cheaply.

<h2>XCVIII</h2>

<p>
And now it happened that the fortunes of Philip Carey, of no consequence to any
but himself, were affected by the events through which his country was passing.
History was being made, and the process was so significant that it seemed
absurd it should touch the life of an obscure medical student. Battle after
battle, Magersfontein, Colenso, Spion Kop, lost on the playing fields of Eton,
had humiliated the nation and dealt the death-blow to the prestige of the
aristocracy and gentry who till then had found no one seriously to oppose their
assertion that they possessed a natural instinct of government. The old order
was being swept away: history was being made indeed. Then the colossus put
forth his strength, and, blundering again, at last blundered into the semblance
of victory. Cronje surrendered at Paardeberg, Ladysmith was relieved, and at
the beginning of March Lord Roberts marched into Bloemfontein.
</p>

<p>
It was two or three days after the news of this reached London that Macalister
came into the tavern in Beak Street and announced joyfully that things were
looking brighter on the Stock Exchange. Peace was in sight, Roberts would march
into Pretoria within a few weeks, and shares were going up already. There was
bound to be a boom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now&rsquo;s the time to come in,&rdquo; he told Philip.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good waiting till the public gets on to it. It&rsquo;s now
or never.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He had inside information. The manager of a mine in South Africa had cabled to
the senior partner of his firm that the plant was uninjured. They would start
working again as soon as possible. It wasn&rsquo;t a speculation, it was an
investment. To show how good a thing the senior partner thought it Macalister
told Philip that he had bought five hundred shares for both his sisters: he
never put them into anything that wasn&rsquo;t as safe as the Bank of England.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to put my shirt on it myself,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
The shares were two and an eighth to a quarter. He advised Philip not to be
greedy, but to be satisfied with a ten-shilling rise. He was buying three
hundred for himself and suggested that Philip should do the same. He would hold
them and sell when he thought fit. Philip had great faith in him, partly
because he was a Scotsman and therefore by nature cautious, and partly because
he had been right before. He jumped at the suggestion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I daresay we shall be able to sell before the account,&rdquo; said
Macalister, &ldquo;but if not, I&rsquo;ll arrange to carry them over for
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It seemed a capital system to Philip. You held on till you got your profit, and
you never even had to put your hand in your pocket. He began to watch the Stock
Exchange columns of the paper with new interest. Next day everything was up a
little, and Macalister wrote to say that he had had to pay two and a quarter
for the shares. He said that the market was firm. But in a day or two there was
a set-back. The news that came from South Africa was less reassuring, and
Philip with anxiety saw that his shares had fallen to two; but Macalister was
optimistic, the Boers couldn&rsquo;t hold out much longer, and he was willing
to bet a top-hat that Roberts would march into Johannesburg before the middle
of April. At the account Philip had to pay out nearly forty pounds. It worried
him considerably, but he felt that the only course was to hold on: in his
circumstances the loss was too great for him to pocket. For two or three weeks
nothing happened; the Boers would not understand that they were beaten and
nothing remained for them but to surrender: in fact they had one or two small
successes, and Philip&rsquo;s shares fell half a crown more. It became evident
that the war was not finished. There was a lot of selling. When Macalister saw
Philip he was pessimistic.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure if the best thing wouldn&rsquo;t be to cut the loss.
I&rsquo;ve been paying out about as much as I want to in differences.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was sick with anxiety. He could not sleep at night; he bolted his
breakfast, reduced now to tea and bread and butter, in order to get over to the
club reading-room and see the paper; sometimes the news was bad, and sometimes
there was no news at all, but when the shares moved it was to go down. He did
not know what to do. If he sold now he would lose altogether hard on three
hundred and fifty pounds; and that would leave him only eighty pounds to go on
with. He wished with all his heart that he had never been such a fool as to
dabble on the Stock Exchange, but the only thing was to hold on; something
decisive might happen any day and the shares would go up; he did not hope now
for a profit, but he wanted to make good his loss. It was his only chance of
finishing his course at the hospital. The Summer session was beginning in May,
and at the end of it he meant to take the examination in midwifery. Then he
would only have a year more; he reckoned it out carefully and came to the
conclusion that he could manage it, fees and all, on a hundred and fifty
pounds; but that was the least it could possibly be done on.
</p>

<p>
Early in April he went to the tavern in Beak Street anxious to see Macalister.
It eased him a little to discuss the situation with him; and to realise that
numerous people beside himself were suffering from loss of money made his own
trouble a little less intolerable. But when Philip arrived no one was there but
Hayward, and no sooner had Philip seated himself than he said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sailing for the Cape on Sunday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you!&rdquo; exclaimed Philip.
</p>

<p>
Hayward was the last person he would have expected to do anything of the kind.
At the hospital men were going out now in numbers; the Government was glad to
get anyone who was qualified; and others, going out as troopers, wrote home
that they had been put on hospital work as soon as it was learned that they
were medical students. A wave of patriotic feeling had swept over the country,
and volunteers were coming from all ranks of society.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you going as?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, in the Dorset Yeomanry. I&rsquo;m going as a trooper.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip had known Hayward for eight years. The youthful intimacy which had come
from Philip&rsquo;s enthusiastic admiration for the man who could tell him of
art and literature had long since vanished; but habit had taken its place; and
when Hayward was in London they saw one another once or twice a week. He still
talked about books with a delicate appreciation. Philip was not yet tolerant,
and sometimes Hayward&rsquo;s conversation irritated him. He no longer believed
implicitly that nothing in the world was of consequence but art. He resented
Hayward&rsquo;s contempt for action and success. Philip, stirring his punch,
thought of his early friendship and his ardent expectation that Hayward would
do great things; it was long since he had lost all such illusions, and he knew
now that Hayward would never do anything but talk. He found his three hundred a
year more difficult to live on now that he was thirty-five than he had when he
was a young man; and his clothes, though still made by a good tailor, were worn
a good deal longer than at one time he would have thought possible. He was too
stout and no artful arrangement of his fair hair could conceal the fact that he
was bald. His blue eyes were dull and pale. It was not hard to guess that he
drank too much.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What on earth made you think of going out to the Cape?&rdquo; asked
Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know, I thought I ought to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was silent. He felt rather silly. He understood that Hayward was being
driven by an uneasiness in his soul which he could not account for. Some power
within him made it seem necessary to go and fight for his country. It was
strange, since he considered patriotism no more than a prejudice, and,
flattering himself on his cosmopolitanism, he had looked upon England as a
place of exile. His countrymen in the mass wounded his susceptibilities. Philip
wondered what it was that made people do things which were so contrary to all
their theories of life. It would have been reasonable for Hayward to stand
aside and watch with a smile while the barbarians slaughtered one another. It
looked as though men were puppets in the hands of an unknown force, which drove
them to do this and that; and sometimes they used their reason to justify their
actions; and when this was impossible they did the actions in despite of
reason.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;People are very extraordinary,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;I should never
have expected you to go out as a trooper.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hayward smiled, slightly embarrassed, and said nothing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was examined yesterday,&rdquo; he remarked at last. &ldquo;It was
worth while undergoing the gene of it to know that one was perfectly
fit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip noticed that he still used a French word in an affected way when an
English one would have served. But just then Macalister came in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wanted to see you, Carey,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My people don&rsquo;t
feel inclined to hold those shares any more, the market&rsquo;s in such an
awful state, and they want you to take them up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip&rsquo;s heart sank. He knew that was impossible. It meant that he must
accept the loss. His pride made him answer calmly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I think that&rsquo;s worth while. You&rsquo;d
better sell them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very fine to say that, I&rsquo;m not sure if I can. The
market&rsquo;s stagnant, there are no buyers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But they&rsquo;re marked down at one and an eighth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean anything. You can&rsquo;t get that
for them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip did not say anything for a moment. He was trying to collect himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you mean to say they&rsquo;re worth nothing at all?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t say that. Of course they&rsquo;re worth something, but
you see, nobody&rsquo;s buying them now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you must just sell them for what you can get.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Macalister looked at Philip narrowly. He wondered whether he was very hard hit.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, old man, but we&rsquo;re all in the same boat.
No one thought the war was going to hang on this way. I put you into them, but
I was in myself too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter at all,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;One has to
take one&rsquo;s chance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He moved back to the table from which he had got up to talk to Macalister. He
was dumfounded; his head suddenly began to ache furiously; but he did not want
them to think him unmanly. He sat on for an hour. He laughed feverishly at
everything they said. At last he got up to go.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You take it pretty coolly,&rdquo; said Macalister, shaking hands with
him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose anyone likes losing between three and four
hundred pounds.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When Philip got back to his shabby little room he flung himself on his bed, and
gave himself over to his despair. He kept on regretting his folly bitterly; and
though he told himself that it was absurd to regret for what had happened was
inevitable just because it had happened, he could not help himself. He was
utterly miserable. He could not sleep. He remembered all the ways he had wasted
money during the last few years. His head ached dreadfully.
</p>

<p>
The following evening there came by the last post the statement of his account.
He examined his pass-book. He found that when he had paid everything he would
have seven pounds left. Seven pounds! He was thankful he had been able to pay.
It would have been horrible to be obliged to confess to Macalister that he had
not the money. He was dressing in the eye-department during the summer session,
and he had bought an ophthalmoscope off a student who had one to sell. He had
not paid for this, but he lacked the courage to tell the student that he wanted
to go back on his bargain. Also he had to buy certain books. He had about five
pounds to go on with. It lasted him six weeks; then he wrote to his uncle a
letter which he thought very business-like; he said that owing to the war he
had had grave losses and could not go on with his studies unless his uncle came
to his help. He suggested that the Vicar should lend him a hundred and fifty
pounds paid over the next eighteen months in monthly instalments; he would pay
interest on this and promised to refund the capital by degrees when he began to
earn money. He would be qualified in a year and a half at the latest, and he
could be pretty sure then of getting an assistantship at three pounds a week.
His uncle wrote back that he could do nothing. It was not fair to ask him to
sell out when everything was at its worst, and the little he had he felt that
his duty to himself made it necessary for him to keep in case of illness. He
ended the letter with a little homily. He had warned Philip time after time,
and Philip had never paid any attention to him; he could not honestly say he
was surprised; he had long expected that this would be the end of
Philip&rsquo;s extravagance and want of balance. Philip grew hot and cold when
he read this. It had never occurred to him that his uncle would refuse, and he
burst into furious anger; but this was succeeded by utter blankness: if his
uncle would not help him he could not go on at the hospital. Panic seized him
and, putting aside his pride, he wrote again to the Vicar of Blackstable,
placing the case before him more urgently; but perhaps he did not explain
himself properly and his uncle did not realise in what desperate straits he
was, for he answered that he could not change his mind; Philip was twenty-five
and really ought to be earning his living. When he died Philip would come into
a little, but till then he refused to give him a penny. Philip felt in the
letter the satisfaction of a man who for many years had disapproved of his
courses and now saw himself justified.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>XCIX</h2>

<p>
Philip began to pawn his clothes. He reduced his expenses by eating only one
meal a day beside his breakfast; and he ate it, bread and butter and cocoa, at
four so that it should last him till next morning. He was so hungry by nine
o&rsquo;clock that he had to go to bed. He thought of borrowing money from
Lawson, but the fear of a refusal held him back; at last he asked him for five
pounds. Lawson lent it with pleasure, but, as he did so, said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll let me have it back in a week or so, won&rsquo;t you?
I&rsquo;ve got to pay my framer, and I&rsquo;m awfully broke just now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip knew he would not be able to return it, and the thought of what Lawson
would think made him so ashamed that in a couple of days he took the money back
untouched. Lawson was just going out to luncheon and asked Philip to come too.
Philip could hardly eat, he was so glad to get some solid food. On Sunday he
was sure of a good dinner from Athelny. He hesitated to tell the Athelnys what
had happened to him: they had always looked upon him as comparatively
well-to-do, and he had a dread that they would think less well of him if they
knew he was penniless.
</p>

<p>
Though he had always been poor, the possibility of not having enough to eat had
never occurred to him; it was not the sort of thing that happened to the people
among whom he lived; and he was as ashamed as if he had some disgraceful
disease. The situation in which he found himself was quite outside the range of
his experience. He was so taken aback that he did not know what else to do than
to go on at the hospital; he had a vague hope that something would turn up; he
could not quite believe that what was happening to him was true; and he
remembered how during his first term at school he had often thought his life
was a dream from which he would awake to find himself once more at home. But
very soon he foresaw that in a week or so he would have no money at all. He
must set about trying to earn something at once. If he had been qualified, even
with a club-foot, he could have gone out to the Cape, since the demand for
medical men was now great. Except for his deformity he might have enlisted in
one of the yeomanry regiments which were constantly being sent out. He went to
the secretary of the Medical School and asked if he could give him the coaching
of some backward student; but the secretary held out no hope of getting him
anything of the sort. Philip read the advertisement columns of the medical
papers, and he applied for the post of unqualified assistant to a man who had a
dispensary in the Fulham Road. When he went to see him, he saw the doctor
glance at his club-foot; and on hearing that Philip was only in his fourth year
at the hospital he said at once that his experience was insufficient: Philip
understood that this was only an excuse; the man would not have an assistant
who might not be as active as he wanted. Philip turned his attention to other
means of earning money. He knew French and German and thought there might be
some chance of finding a job as correspondence clerk; it made his heart sink,
but he set his teeth; there was nothing else to do. Though too shy to answer
the advertisements which demanded a personal application, he replied to those
which asked for letters; but he had no experience to state and no
recommendations: he was conscious that neither his German nor his French was
commercial; he was ignorant of the terms used in business; he knew neither
shorthand nor typewriting. He could not help recognising that his case was
hopeless. He thought of writing to the solicitor who had been his
father&rsquo;s executor, but he could not bring himself to, for it was contrary
to his express advice that he had sold the mortgages in which his money had
been invested. He knew from his uncle that Mr. Nixon thoroughly disapproved of
him. He had gathered from Philip&rsquo;s year in the accountant&rsquo;s office
that he was idle and incompetent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d sooner starve,&rdquo; Philip muttered to himself.
</p>

<p>
Once or twice the possibility of suicide presented itself to him; it would be
easy to get something from the hospital dispensary, and it was a comfort to
think that if the worst came to the worst he had at hand means of making a
painless end of himself; but it was not a course that he considered seriously.
When Mildred had left him to go with Griffiths his anguish had been so great
that he wanted to die in order to get rid of the pain. He did not feel like
that now. He remembered that the Casualty Sister had told him how people
oftener did away with themselves for want of money than for want of love; and
he chuckled when he thought that he was an exception. He wished only that he
could talk his worries over with somebody, but he could not bring himself to
confess them. He was ashamed. He went on looking for work. He left his rent
unpaid for three weeks, explaining to his landlady that he would get money at
the end of the month; she did not say anything, but pursed her lips and looked
grim. When the end of the month came and she asked if it would be convenient
for him to pay something on account, it made him feel very sick to say that he
could not; he told her he would write to his uncle and was sure to be able to
settle his bill on the following Saturday.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I &rsquo;ope you will, Mr. Carey, because I &rsquo;ave my rent to
pay, and I can&rsquo;t afford to let accounts run on.&rdquo; She did not speak
with anger, but with determination that was rather frightening. She paused for
a moment and then said: &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t pay next Saturday, I shall
&rsquo;ave to complain to the secretary of the &rsquo;ospital.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, that&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked at him for a little and glanced round the bare room. When she spoke
it was without any emphasis, as though it were quite a natural thing to say.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a nice &rsquo;ot joint downstairs, and if you like to
come down to the kitchen you&rsquo;re welcome to a bit of dinner.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip felt himself redden to the soles of his feet, and a sob caught at his
throat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you very much, Mrs. Higgins, but I&rsquo;m not at all
hungry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very good, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When she left the room Philip threw himself on his bed. He had to clench his
fists in order to prevent himself from crying.
</p>

<h2>C</h2>

<p>
Saturday. It was the day on which he had promised to pay his landlady. He had
been expecting something to turn up all through the week. He had found no work.
He had never been driven to extremities before, and he was so dazed that he did
not know what to do. He had at the back of his mind a feeling that the whole
thing was a preposterous joke. He had no more than a few coppers left, he had
sold all the clothes he could do without; he had some books and one or two odds
and ends upon which he might have got a shilling or two, but the landlady was
keeping an eye on his comings and goings: he was afraid she would stop him if
he took anything more from his room. The only thing was to tell her that he
could not pay his bill. He had not the courage. It was the middle of June. The
night was fine and warm. He made up his mind to stay out. He walked slowly
along the Chelsea Embankment, because the river was restful and quiet, till he
was tired, and then sat on a bench and dozed. He did not know how long he
slept; he awoke with a start, dreaming that he was being shaken by a policeman
and told to move on; but when he opened his eyes he found himself alone. He
walked on, he did not know why, and at last came to Chiswick, where he slept
again. Presently the hardness of the bench roused him. The night seemed very
long. He shivered. He was seized with a sense of his misery; and he did not
know what on earth to do: he was ashamed at having slept on the Embankment; it
seemed peculiarly humiliating, and he felt his cheeks flush in the darkness. He
remembered stories he had heard of those who did and how among them were
officers, clergymen, and men who had been to universities: he wondered if he
would become one of them, standing in a line to get soup from a charitable
institution. It would be much better to commit suicide. He could not go on like
that: Lawson would help him when he knew what straits he was in; it was absurd
to let his pride prevent him from asking for assistance. He wondered why he had
come such a cropper. He had always tried to do what he thought best, and
everything had gone wrong. He had helped people when he could, he did not think
he had been more selfish than anyone else, it seemed horribly unjust that he
should be reduced to such a pass.
</p>

<p>
But it was no good thinking about it. He walked on. It was now light: the river
was beautiful in the silence, and there was something mysterious in the early
day; it was going to be very fine, and the sky, pale in the dawn, was
cloudless. He felt very tired, and hunger was gnawing at his entrails, but he
could not sit still; he was constantly afraid of being spoken to by a
policeman. He dreaded the mortification of that. He felt dirty and wished he
could have a wash. At last he found himself at Hampton Court. He felt that if
he did not have something to eat he would cry. He chose a cheap eating-house
and went in; there was a smell of hot things, and it made him feel slightly
sick: he meant to eat something nourishing enough to keep up for the rest of
the day, but his stomach revolted at the sight of food. He had a cup of tea and
some bread and butter. He remembered then that it was Sunday and he could go to
the Athelnys; he thought of the roast beef and the Yorkshire pudding they would
eat; but he was fearfully tired and could not face the happy, noisy family. He
was feeling morose and wretched. He wanted to be left alone. He made up his
mind that he would go into the gardens of the palace and lie down. His bones
ached. Perhaps he would find a pump so that he could wash his hands and face
and drink something; he was very thirsty; and now that he was no longer hungry
he thought with pleasure of the flowers and the lawns and the great leafy
trees. He felt that there he could think out better what he must do. He lay on
the grass, in the shade, and lit his pipe. For economy&rsquo;s sake he had for
a long time confined himself to two pipes a day; he was thankful now that his
pouch was full. He did not know what people did when they had no money.
Presently he fell asleep. When he awoke it was nearly mid-day, and he thought
that soon he must be setting out for London so as to be there in the early
morning and answer any advertisements which seemed to promise. He thought of
his uncle, who had told him that he would leave him at his death the little he
had; Philip did not in the least know how much this was: it could not be more
than a few hundred pounds. He wondered whether he could raise money on the
reversion. Not without the old man&rsquo;s consent, and that he would never
give.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The only thing I can do is to hang on somehow till he dies.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip reckoned his age. The Vicar of Blackstable was well over seventy. He had
chronic bronchitis, but many old men had that and lived on indefinitely.
Meanwhile something must turn up; Philip could not get away from the feeling
that his position was altogether abnormal; people in his particular station did
not starve. It was because he could not bring himself to believe in the reality
of his experience that he did not give way to utter despair. He made up his
mind to borrow half a sovereign from Lawson. He stayed in the garden all day
and smoked when he felt very hungry; he did not mean to eat anything until he
was setting out again for London: it was a long way and he must keep up his
strength for that. He started when the day began to grow cooler, and slept on
benches when he was tired. No one disturbed him. He had a wash and brush up,
and a shave at Victoria, some tea and bread and butter, and while he was eating
this read the advertisement columns of the morning paper. As he looked down
them his eye fell upon an announcement asking for a salesman in the
&lsquo;furnishing drapery&rsquo; department of some well-known stores. He had a
curious little sinking of the heart, for with his middle-class prejudices it
seemed dreadful to go into a shop; but he shrugged his shoulders, after all
what did it matter? and he made up his mind to have a shot at it. He had a
queer feeling that by accepting every humiliation, by going out to meet it
even, he was forcing the hand of fate. When he presented himself, feeling
horribly shy, in the department at nine o&rsquo;clock he found that many others
were there before him. They were of all ages, from boys of sixteen to men of
forty; some were talking to one another in undertones, but most were silent;
and when he took up his place those around him gave him a look of hostility. He
heard one man say:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The only thing I look forward to is getting my refusal soon enough to
give me time to look elsewhere.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man, standing next him, glanced at Philip and asked:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Had any experience?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
He paused a moment and then made a remark: &ldquo;Even the smaller houses
won&rsquo;t see you without appointment after lunch.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip looked at the assistants. Some were draping chintzes and cretonnes, and
others, his neighbour told him were preparing country orders that had come in
by post. At about a quarter past nine the buyer arrived. He heard one of the
men who were waiting say to another that it was Mr. Gibbons. He was
middle-aged, short and corpulent, with a black beard and dark, greasy hair. He
had brisk movements and a clever face. He wore a silk hat and a frock coat, the
lapel of which was adorned with a white geranium surrounded by leaves. He went
into his office, leaving the door open; it was very small and contained only an
American roll-desk in the corner, a bookcase, and a cupboard. The men standing
outside watched him mechanically take the geranium out of his coat and put it
in an ink-pot filled with water. It was against the rules to wear flowers in
business.
</p>

<p>
During the day the department men who wanted to keep in with the governor
admired the flower.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen better,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t
grow it yourself?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes I did,&rdquo; he smiled, and a gleam of pride filled his intelligent
eyes.
</p>

<p>
He took off his hat and changed his coat, glanced at the letters and then at
the men who were waiting to see him. He made a slight sign with one finger, and
the first in the queue stepped into the office. They filed past him one by one
and answered his questions. He put them very briefly, keeping his eyes fixed on
the applicant&rsquo;s face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Age? Experience? Why did you leave your job?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He listened to the replies without expression. When it came to Philip&rsquo;s
turn he fancied that Mr. Gibbons stared at him curiously. Philip&rsquo;s
clothes were neat and tolerably cut. He looked a little different from the
others.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Experience?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I haven&rsquo;t any,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No good.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip walked out of the office. The ordeal had been so much less painful than
he expected that he felt no particular disappointment. He could hardly hope to
succeed in getting a place the first time he tried. He had kept the newspaper
and now looked at the advertisements again: a shop in Holborn needed a salesman
too, and he went there; but when he arrived he found that someone had already
been engaged. If he wanted to get anything to eat that day he must go to
Lawson&rsquo;s studio before he went out to luncheon, so he made his way along
the Brompton Road to Yeoman&rsquo;s Row.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, I&rsquo;m rather broke till the end of the month,&rdquo; he said
as soon as he found an opportunity. &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d lend me half a
sovereign, will you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was incredible the difficulty he found in asking for money; and he
remembered the casual way, as though almost they were conferring a favour, men
at the hospital had extracted small sums out of him which they had no intention
of repaying.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Like a shot,&rdquo; said Lawson.
</p>

<p>
But when he put his hand in his pocket he found that he had only eight
shillings. Philip&rsquo;s heart sank.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh well, lend me five bob, will you?&rdquo; he said lightly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here you are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip went to the public baths in Westminster and spent sixpence on a bath.
Then he got himself something to eat. He did not know what to do with himself
in the afternoon. He would not go back to the hospital in case anyone should
ask him questions, and besides, he had nothing to do there now; they would
wonder in the two or three departments he had worked in why he did not come,
but they must think what they chose, it did not matter: he would not be the
first student who had dropped out without warning. He went to the free library,
and looked at the papers till they wearied him, then he took out
Stevenson&rsquo;s New Arabian Nights; but he found he could not read: the words
meant nothing to him, and he continued to brood over his helplessness. He kept
on thinking the same things all the time, and the fixity of his thoughts made
his head ache. At last, craving for fresh air, he went into the Green Park and
lay down on the grass. He thought miserably of his deformity, which made it
impossible for him to go to the war. He went to sleep and dreamt that he was
suddenly sound of foot and out at the Cape in a regiment of Yeomanry; the
pictures he had looked at in the illustrated papers gave materials for his
fancy; and he saw himself on the Veldt, in khaki, sitting with other men round
a fire at night. When he awoke he found that it was still quite light, and
presently he heard Big Ben strike seven. He had twelve hours to get through
with nothing to do. He dreaded the interminable night. The sky was overcast and
he feared it would rain; he would have to go to a lodging-house where he could
get a bed; he had seen them advertised on lamps outside houses in Lambeth: Good
Beds sixpence; he had never been inside one, and dreaded the foul smell and the
vermin. He made up his mind to stay in the open air if he possibly could. He
remained in the park till it was closed and then began to walk about. He was
very tired. The thought came to him that an accident would be a piece of luck,
so that he could be taken to a hospital and lie there, in a clean bed, for
weeks. At midnight he was so hungry that he could not go without food any more,
so he went to a coffee stall at Hyde Park Corner and ate a couple of potatoes
and had a cup of coffee. Then he walked again. He felt too restless to sleep,
and he had a horrible dread of being moved on by the police. He noted that he
was beginning to look upon the constable from quite a new angle. This was the
third night he had spent out. Now and then he sat on the benches in Piccadilly
and towards morning he strolled down to The Embankment. He listened to the
striking of Big Ben, marking every quarter of an hour, and reckoned out how
long it left till the city woke again. In the morning he spent a few coppers on
making himself neat and clean, bought a paper to read the advertisements, and
set out once more on the search for work.
</p>

<p>
He went on in this way for several days. He had very little food and began to
feel weak and ill, so that he had hardly enough energy to go on looking for the
work which seemed so desperately hard to find. He was growing used now to the
long waiting at the back of a shop on the chance that he would be taken on, and
the curt dismissal. He walked to all parts of London in answer to the
advertisements, and he came to know by sight men who applied as fruitlessly as
himself. One or two tried to make friends with him, but he was too tired and
too wretched to accept their advances. He did not go any more to Lawson,
because he owed him five shillings. He began to be too dazed to think clearly
and ceased very much to care what would happen to him. He cried a good deal. At
first he was very angry with himself for this and ashamed, but he found it
relieved him, and somehow made him feel less hungry. In the very early morning
he suffered a good deal from cold. One night he went into his room to change
his linen; he slipped in about three, when he was quite sure everyone would be
asleep, and out again at five; he lay on the bed and its softness was
enchanting; all his bones ached, and as he lay he revelled in the pleasure of
it; it was so delicious that he did not want to go to sleep. He was growing
used to want of food and did not feel very hungry, but only weak. Constantly
now at the back of his mind was the thought of doing away with himself, but he
used all the strength he had not to dwell on it, because he was afraid the
temptation would get hold of him so that he would not be able to help himself.
He kept on saying to himself that it would be absurd to commit suicide, since
something must happen soon; he could not get over the impression that his
situation was too preposterous to be taken quite seriously; it was like an
illness which must be endured but from which he was bound to recover. Every
night he swore that nothing would induce him to put up with such another and
determined next morning to write to his uncle, or to Mr. Nixon, the solicitor,
or to Lawson; but when the time came he could not bring himself to make the
humiliating confession of his utter failure. He did not know how Lawson would
take it. In their friendship Lawson had been scatter-brained and he had prided
himself on his common sense. He would have to tell the whole history of his
folly. He had an uneasy feeling that Lawson, after helping him, would turn the
cold shoulder on him. His uncle and the solicitor would of course do something
for him, but he dreaded their reproaches. He did not want anyone to reproach
him: he clenched his teeth and repeated that what had happened was inevitable
just because it had happened. Regret was absurd.
</p>

<p>
The days were unending, and the five shillings Lawson had lent him would not
last much longer. Philip longed for Sunday to come so that he could go to
Athelny&rsquo;s. He did not know what prevented him from going there sooner,
except perhaps that he wanted so badly to get through on his own; for Athelny,
who had been in straits as desperate, was the only person who could do anything
for him. Perhaps after dinner he could bring himself to tell Athelny that he
was in difficulties. Philip repeated to himself over and over again what he
should say to him. He was dreadfully afraid that Athelny would put him off with
airy phrases: that would be so horrible that he wanted to delay as long as
possible the putting of him to the test. Philip had lost all confidence in his
fellows.
</p>

<p>
Saturday night was cold and raw. Philip suffered horribly. From midday on
Saturday till he dragged himself wearily to Athelny&rsquo;s house he ate
nothing. He spent his last twopence on Sunday morning on a wash and a brush up
in the lavatory at Charing Cross.

<h2>CI</h2>

<p>
When Philip rang a head was put out of the window, and in a minute he heard a
noisy clatter on the stairs as the children ran down to let him in. It was a
pale, anxious, thin face that he bent down for them to kiss. He was so moved by
their exuberant affection that, to give himself time to recover, he made
excuses to linger on the stairs. He was in a hysterical state and almost
anything was enough to make him cry. They asked him why he had not come on the
previous Sunday, and he told them he had been ill; they wanted to know what was
the matter with him; and Philip, to amuse them, suggested a mysterious ailment,
the name of which, double-barrelled and barbarous with its mixture of Greek and
Latin (medical nomenclature bristled with such), made them shriek with delight.
They dragged Philip into the parlour and made him repeat it for their
father&rsquo;s edification. Athelny got up and shook hands with him. He stared
at Philip, but with his round, bulging eyes he always seemed to stare, Philip
did not know why on this occasion it made him self-conscious.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We missed you last Sunday,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
Philip could never tell lies without embarrassment, and he was scarlet when he
finished his explanation for not coming. Then Mrs. Athelny entered and shook
hands with him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re better, Mr. Carey,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
He did not know why she imagined that anything had been the matter with him,
for the kitchen door was closed when he came up with the children, and they had
not left him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dinner won&rsquo;t be ready for another ten minutes,&rdquo; she said, in
her slow drawl. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you have an egg beaten up in a glass of milk
while you&rsquo;re waiting?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a look of concern on her face which made Philip uncomfortable. He
forced a laugh and answered that he was not at all hungry. Sally came in to lay
the table, and Philip began to chaff her. It was the family joke that she would
be as fat as an aunt of Mrs. Athelny, called Aunt Elizabeth, whom the children
had never seen but regarded as the type of obscene corpulence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, what HAS happened since I saw you last, Sally?&rdquo; Philip
began.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing that I know of.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;ve been putting on weight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she retorted.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a perfect skeleton.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip reddened.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a tu quoque, Sally,&rdquo; cried her father. &ldquo;You
will be fined one golden hair of your head. Jane, fetch the shears.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, he is thin, father,&rdquo; remonstrated Sally. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
just skin and bone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the question, child. He is at perfect liberty to be
thin, but your obesity is contrary to decorum.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As he spoke he put his arm proudly round her waist and looked at her with
admiring eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me get on with the table, father. If I am comfortable there are some
who don&rsquo;t seem to mind it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The hussy!&rdquo; cried Athelny, with a dramatic wave of the hand.
&ldquo;She taunts me with the notorious fact that Joseph, a son of Levi who
sells jewels in Holborn, has made her an offer of marriage.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you accepted him, Sally?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know father better than that by this time? There&rsquo;s
not a word of truth in it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, if he hasn&rsquo;t made you an offer of marriage,&rdquo; cried
Athelny, &ldquo;by Saint George and Merry England, I will seize him by the nose
and demand of him immediately what are his intentions.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sit down, father, dinner&rsquo;s ready. Now then, you children, get
along with you and wash your hands all of you, and don&rsquo;t shirk it,
because I mean to look at them before you have a scrap of dinner, so
there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip thought he was ravenous till he began to eat, but then discovered that
his stomach turned against food, and he could eat hardly at all. His brain was
weary; and he did not notice that Athelny, contrary to his habit, spoke very
little. Philip was relieved to be sitting in a comfortable house, but every now
and then he could not prevent himself from glancing out of the window. The day
was tempestuous. The fine weather had broken; and it was cold, and there was a
bitter wind; now and again gusts of rain drove against the window. Philip
wondered what he should do that night. The Athelnys went to bed early, and he
could not stay where he was after ten o&rsquo;clock. His heart sank at the
thought of going out into the bleak darkness. It seemed more terrible now that
he was with his friends than when he was outside and alone. He kept on saying
to himself that there were plenty more who would be spending the night out of
doors. He strove to distract his mind by talking, but in the middle of his
words a spatter of rain against the window would make him start.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like March weather,&rdquo; said Athelny. &ldquo;Not the sort
of day one would like to be crossing the Channel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Presently they finished, and Sally came in and cleared away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would you like a twopenny stinker?&rdquo; said Athelny, handing him a
cigar.
</p>

<p>
Philip took it and inhaled the smoke with delight. It soothed him
extraordinarily. When Sally had finished Athelny told her to shut the door
after her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now we shan&rsquo;t be disturbed,&rdquo; he said, turning to Philip.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve arranged with Betty not to let the children come in till I
call them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip gave him a startled look, but before he could take in the meaning of his
words, Athelny, fixing his glasses on his nose with the gesture habitual to
him, went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wrote to you last Sunday to ask if anything was the matter with you,
and as you didn&rsquo;t answer I went to your rooms on Wednesday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip turned his head away and did not answer. His heart began to beat
violently. Athelny did not speak, and presently the silence seemed intolerable
to Philip. He could not think of a single word to say.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your landlady told me you hadn&rsquo;t been in since Saturday night, and
she said you owed her for the last month. Where have you been sleeping all this
week?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It made Philip sick to answer. He stared out of the window.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nowhere.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I tried to find you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Betty and I have been just as broke in our day, only we had babies to
look after. Why didn&rsquo;t you come here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was afraid he was going to cry. He felt very weak. He shut his eyes and
frowned, trying to control himself. He felt a sudden flash of anger with
Athelny because he would not leave him alone; but he was broken; and presently,
his eyes still closed, slowly in order to keep his voice steady, he told him
the story of his adventures during the last few weeks. As he spoke it seemed to
him that he had behaved inanely, and it made it still harder to tell. He felt
that Athelny would think him an utter fool.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re coming to live with us till you find something to
do,&rdquo; said Athelny, when he had finished.
</p>

<p>
Philip flushed, he knew not why.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s awfully kind of you, but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll
do that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip did not answer. He had refused instinctively from fear that he would be
a bother, and he had a natural bashfulness of accepting favours. He knew
besides that the Athelnys lived from hand to mouth, and with their large family
had neither space nor money to entertain a stranger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course you must come here,&rdquo; said Athelny. &ldquo;Thorpe will
tuck in with one of his brothers and you can sleep in his bed. You don&rsquo;t
suppose your food&rsquo;s going to make any difference to us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was afraid to speak, and Athelny, going to the door, called his wife.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Betty,&rdquo; he said, when she came in, &ldquo;Mr. Carey&rsquo;s coming
to live with us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that is nice,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and get the bed
ready.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She spoke in such a hearty, friendly tone, taking everything for granted, that
Philip was deeply touched. He never expected people to be kind to him, and when
they were it surprised and moved him. Now he could not prevent two large tears
from rolling down his cheeks. The Athelnys discussed the arrangements and
pretended not to notice to what a state his weakness had brought him. When Mrs.
Athelny left them Philip leaned back in his chair, and looking out of the
window laughed a little.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a very nice night to be out, is it?&rdquo;
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">

<h2>CII</h2>

<p>
Athelny told Philip that he could easily get him something to do in the large
firm of linendrapers in which himself worked. Several of the assistants had
gone to the war, and Lynn and Sedley with patriotic zeal had promised to keep
their places open for them. They put the work of the heroes on those who
remained, and since they did not increase the wages of these were able at once
to exhibit public spirit and effect an economy; but the war continued and trade
was less depressed; the holidays were coming, when numbers of the staff went
away for a fortnight at a time: they were bound to engage more assistants.
Philip&rsquo;s experience had made him doubtful whether even then they would
engage him; but Athelny, representing himself as a person of consequence in the
firm, insisted that the manager could refuse him nothing. Philip, with his
training in Paris, would be very useful; it was only a matter of waiting a
little and he was bound to get a well-paid job to design costumes and draw
posters. Philip made a poster for the summer sale and Athelny took it away. Two
days later he brought it back, saying that the manager admired it very much and
regretted with all his heart that there was no vacancy just then in that
department. Philip asked whether there was nothing else he could do.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you quite sure?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, the fact is they&rsquo;re advertising for a shop-walker
tomorrow,&rdquo; said Athelny, looking at him doubtfully through his glasses.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you think I stand any chance of getting it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Athelny was a little confused; he had led Philip to expect something much more
splendid; on the other hand he was too poor to go on providing him indefinitely
with board and lodging.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You might take it while you wait for something better. You always stand
a better chance if you&rsquo;re engaged by the firm already.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not proud, you know,&rdquo; smiled Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you decide on that you must be there at a quarter to nine tomorrow
morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the war there was evidently much difficulty in finding work,
for when Philip went to the shop many men were waiting already. He recognised
some whom he had seen in his own searching, and there was one whom he had
noticed lying about the park in the afternoon. To Philip now that suggested
that he was as homeless as himself and passed the night out of doors. The men
were of all sorts, old and young, tall and short; but every one had tried to
make himself smart for the interview with the manager: they had carefully
brushed hair and scrupulously clean hands. They waited in a passage which
Philip learnt afterwards led up to the dining-hall and the work rooms; it was
broken every few yards by five or six steps. Though there was electric light in
the shop here was only gas, with wire cages over it for protection, and it
flared noisily. Philip arrived punctually, but it was nearly ten o&rsquo;clock
when he was admitted into the office. It was three-cornered, like a cut of
cheese lying on its side: on the walls were pictures of women in corsets, and
two poster-proofs, one of a man in pyjamas, green and white in large stripes,
and the other of a ship in full sail ploughing an azure sea: on the sail was
printed in large letters &lsquo;great white sale.&rsquo; The widest side of the
office was the back of one of the shop-windows, which was being dressed at the
time, and an assistant went to and fro during the interview. The manager was
reading a letter. He was a florid man, with sandy hair and a large sandy
moustache; from the middle of his watch-chain hung a bunch of football medals.
He sat in his shirt sleeves at a large desk with a telephone by his side;
before him were the day&rsquo;s advertisements, Athelny&rsquo;s work, and
cuttings from newspapers pasted on a card. He gave Philip a glance but did not
speak to him; he dictated a letter to the typist, a girl who sat at a small
table in one corner; then he asked Philip his name, age, and what experience he
had had. He spoke with a cockney twang in a high, metallic voice which he
seemed not able always to control; Philip noticed that his upper teeth were
large and protruding; they gave you the impression that they were loose and
would come out if you gave them a sharp tug.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think Mr. Athelny has spoken to you about me,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you are the young feller who did that poster?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No good to us, you know, not a bit of good.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked Philip up and down. He seemed to notice that Philip was in some way
different from the men who had preceded him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d &rsquo;ave to get a frock coat, you know. I suppose you
&rsquo;aven&rsquo;t got one. You seem a respectable young feller. I suppose you
found art didn&rsquo;t pay.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip could not tell whether he meant to engage him or not. He threw remarks
at him in a hostile way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your home?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My father and mother died when I was a child.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I like to give young fellers a chance. Many&rsquo;s the one I&rsquo;ve
given their chance to and they&rsquo;re managers of departments now. And
they&rsquo;re grateful to me, I&rsquo;ll say that for them. They know what I
done for them. Start at the bottom of the ladder, that&rsquo;s the only way to
learn the business, and then if you stick to it there&rsquo;s no knowing what
it can lead to. If you suit, one of these days you may find yourself in a
position like what mine is. Bear that in mind, young feller.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very anxious to do my best, sir,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
He knew that he must put in the sir whenever he could, but it sounded odd to
him, and he was afraid of overdoing it. The manager liked talking. It gave him
a happy consciousness of his own importance, and he did not give Philip his
decision till he had used a great many words.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I daresay you&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; he said at last, in a pompous
way. &ldquo;Anyhow I don&rsquo;t mind giving you a trial.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you very much, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can start at once. I&rsquo;ll give you six shillings a week and your
keep. Everything found, you know; the six shillings is only pocket money, to do
what you like with, paid monthly. Start on Monday. I suppose you&rsquo;ve got
no cause of complaint with that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Harrington Street, d&rsquo;you know where that is, Shaftesbury Avenue.
That&rsquo;s where you sleep. Number ten, it is. You can sleep there on Sunday
night, if you like; that&rsquo;s just as you please, or you can send your box
there on Monday.&rdquo; The manager nodded: &ldquo;Good-morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<h2>CIII</h2>

<p>
Mrs. Athelny lent Philip money to pay his landlady enough of her bill to let
him take his things away. For five shillings and the pawn-ticket on a suit he
was able to get from a pawnbroker a frock coat which fitted him fairly well. He
redeemed the rest of his clothes. He sent his box to Harrington Street by
Carter Patterson and on Monday morning went with Athelny to the shop. Athelny
introduced him to the buyer of the costumes and left him. The buyer was a
pleasant, fussy little man of thirty, named Sampson; he shook hands with
Philip, and, in order to show his own accomplishment of which he was very
proud, asked him if he spoke French. He was surprised when Philip told him he
did.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Any other language?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I speak German.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! I go over to Paris myself occasionally. Parlez-vous francais? Ever
been to Maxim&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was stationed at the top of the stairs in the &lsquo;costumes.&rsquo;
His work consisted in directing people to the various departments. There seemed
a great many of them as Mr. Sampson tripped them off his tongue. Suddenly he
noticed that Philip limped.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with your leg?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a club-foot,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;But it
doesn&rsquo;t prevent my walking or anything like that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The buyer looked at it for a moment doubtfully, and Philip surmised that he was
wondering why the manager had engaged him. Philip knew that he had not noticed
there was anything the matter with him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect you to get them all correct the first day. If
you&rsquo;re in any doubt all you&rsquo;ve got to do is to ask one of the young
ladies.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Sampson turned away; and Philip, trying to remember where this or the other
department was, watched anxiously for the customer in search of information. At
one o&rsquo;clock he went up to dinner. The dining-room, on the top floor of
the vast building, was large, long, and well lit; but all the windows were shut
to keep out the dust, and there was a horrid smell of cooking. There were long
tables covered with cloths, with big glass bottles of water at intervals, and
down the centre salt cellars and bottles of vinegar. The assistants crowded in
noisily, and sat down on forms still warm from those who had dined at
twelve-thirty.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No pickles,&rdquo; remarked the man next to Philip.
</p>

<p>
He was a tall thin young man, with a hooked nose and a pasty face; he had a
long head, unevenly shaped as though the skull had been pushed in here and
there oddly, and on his forehead and neck were large acne spots red and
inflamed. His name was Harris. Philip discovered that on some days there were
large soup-plates down the table full of mixed pickles. They were very popular.
There were no knives and forks, but in a minute a large fat boy in a white coat
came in with a couple of handfuls of them and threw them loudly on the middle
of the table. Each man took what he wanted; they were warm and greasy from
recent washing in dirty water. Plates of meat swimming in gravy were handed
round by boys in white jackets, and as they flung each plate down with the
quick gesture of a prestidigitator the gravy slopped over on to the
table-cloth. Then they brought large dishes of cabbages and potatoes; the sight
of them turned Philip&rsquo;s stomach; he noticed that everyone poured
quantities of vinegar over them. The noise was awful. They talked and laughed
and shouted, and there was the clatter of knives and forks, and strange sounds
of eating. Philip was glad to get back into the department. He was beginning to
remember where each one was, and had less often to ask one of the assistants,
when somebody wanted to know the way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;First to the right. Second on the left, madam.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
One or two of the girls spoke to him, just a word when things were slack, and
he felt they were taking his measure. At five he was sent up again to the
dining-room for tea. He was glad to sit down. There were large slices of bread
heavily spread with butter; and many had pots of jam, which were kept in the
&lsquo;store&rsquo; and had their names written on.
</p>

<p>
Philip was exhausted when work stopped at half past six. Harris, the man he had
sat next to at dinner, offered to take him over to Harrington Street to show
him where he was to sleep. He told Philip there was a spare bed in his room,
and, as the other rooms were full, he expected Philip would be put there. The
house in Harrington Street had been a bootmaker&rsquo;s; and the shop was used
as a bed-room; but it was very dark, since the window had been boarded three
parts up, and as this did not open the only ventilation came from a small
skylight at the far end. There was a musty smell, and Philip was thankful that
he would not have to sleep there. Harris took him up to the sitting-room, which
was on the first floor; it had an old piano in it with a keyboard that looked
like a row of decayed teeth; and on the table in a cigar-box without a lid was
a set of dominoes; old numbers of The Strand Magazine and of The Graphic were
lying about. The other rooms were used as bed-rooms. That in which Philip was
to sleep was at the top of the house. There were six beds in it, and a trunk or
a box stood by the side of each. The only furniture was a chest of drawers: it
had four large drawers and two small ones, and Philip as the new-comer had one
of these; there were keys to them, but as they were all alike they were not of
much use, and Harris advised him to keep his valuables in his trunk. There was
a looking-glass on the chimney-piece. Harris showed Philip the lavatory, which
was a fairly large room with eight basins in a row, and here all the inmates
did their washing. It led into another room in which were two baths,
discoloured, the woodwork stained with soap; and in them were dark rings at
various intervals which indicated the water marks of different baths.
</p>

<p>
When Harris and Philip went back to their bed-room they found a tall man
changing his clothes and a boy of sixteen whistling as loud as he could while
he brushed his hair. In a minute or two without saying a word to anybody the
tall man went out. Harris winked at the boy, and the boy, whistling still,
winked back. Harris told Philip that the man was called Prior; he had been in
the army and now served in the silks; he kept pretty much to himself, and he
went off every night, just like that, without so much as a good-evening, to see
his girl. Harris went out too, and only the boy remained to watch Philip
curiously while he unpacked his things. His name was Bell and he was serving
his time for nothing in the haberdashery. He was much interested in
Philip&rsquo;s evening clothes. He told him about the other men in the room and
asked him every sort of question about himself. He was a cheerful youth, and in
the intervals of conversation sang in a half-broken voice snatches of
music-hall songs. When Philip had finished he went out to walk about the
streets and look at the crowd; occasionally he stopped outside the doors of
restaurants and watched the people going in; he felt hungry, so he bought a
bath bun and ate it while he strolled along. He had been given a latch-key by
the prefect, the man who turned out the gas at a quarter past eleven, but
afraid of being locked out he returned in good time; he had learned already the
system of fines: you had to pay a shilling if you came in after eleven, and
half a crown after a quarter past, and you were reported besides: if it
happened three times you were dismissed.
</p>

<p>
All but the soldier were in when Philip arrived and two were already in bed.
Philip was greeted with cries.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Clarence! Naughty boy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He discovered that Bell had dressed up the bolster in his evening clothes. The
boy was delighted with his joke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must wear them at the social evening, Clarence.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll catch the belle of Lynn&rsquo;s, if he&rsquo;s not
careful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip had already heard of the social evenings, for the money stopped from the
wages to pay for them was one of the grievances of the staff. It was only two
shillings a month, and it covered medical attendance and the use of a library
of worn novels; but as four shillings a month besides was stopped for washing,
Philip discovered that a quarter of his six shillings a week would never be
paid to him.
</p>

<p>
Most of the men were eating thick slices of fat bacon between a roll of bread
cut in two. These sandwiches, the assistants&rsquo; usual supper, were supplied
by a small shop a few doors off at twopence each. The soldier rolled in;
silently, rapidly, took off his clothes and threw himself into bed. At ten
minutes past eleven the gas gave a big jump and five minutes later went out.
The soldier went to sleep, but the others crowded round the big window in their
pyjamas and night-shirts and, throwing remains of their sandwiches at the women
who passed in the street below, shouted to them facetious remarks. The house
opposite, six storeys high, was a workshop for Jewish tailors who left off work
at eleven; the rooms were brightly lit and there were no blinds to the windows.
The sweater&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;the family consisted of father, mother, two
small boys, and a girl of twenty&mdash;went round the house to put out the
lights when work was over, and sometimes she allowed herself to be made love to
by one of the tailors. The shop assistants in Philip&rsquo;s room got a lot of
amusement out of watching the manoeuvres of one man or another to stay behind,
and they made small bets on which would succeed. At midnight the people were
turned out of the Harrington Arms at the end of the street, and soon after they
all went to bed: Bell, who slept nearest the door, made his way across the room
by jumping from bed to bed, and even when he got to his own would not stop
talking. At last everything was silent but for the steady snoring of the
soldier, and Philip went to sleep.
</p>

<p>
He was awaked at seven by the loud ringing of a bell, and by a quarter to eight
they were all dressed and hurrying downstairs in their stockinged feet to pick
out their boots. They laced them as they ran along to the shop in Oxford Street
for breakfast. If they were a minute later than eight they got none, nor, once
in, were they allowed out to get themselves anything to eat. Sometimes, if they
knew they could not get into the building in time, they stopped at the little
shop near their quarters and bought a couple of buns; but this cost money, and
most went without food till dinner. Philip ate some bread and butter, drank a
cup of tea, and at half past eight began his day&rsquo;s work again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;First to the right. Second on the left, madam.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Soon he began to answer the questions quite mechanically. The work was
monotonous and very tiring. After a few days his feet hurt him so that he could
hardly stand: the thick soft carpets made them burn, and at night his socks
were painful to remove. It was a common complaint, and his fellow
&lsquo;floormen&rsquo; told him that socks and boots just rotted away from the
continual sweating. All the men in his room suffered in the same fashion, and
they relieved the pain by sleeping with their feet outside the bed-clothes. At
first Philip could not walk at all and was obliged to spend a good many of his
evenings in the sitting-room at Harrington Street with his feet in a pail of
cold water. His companion on these occasions was Bell, the lad in the
haberdashery, who stayed in often to arrange the stamps he collected. As he
fastened them with little pieces of stamp-paper he whistled monotonously.
</p>

<h2>CIV</h2>

<p>
The social evenings took place on alternate Mondays. There was one at the
beginning of Philip&rsquo;s second week at Lynn&rsquo;s. He arranged to go with
one of the women in his department.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Meet &rsquo;em &rsquo;alf-way,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;same as I
do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was Mrs. Hodges, a little woman of five-and-forty, with badly dyed hair;
she had a yellow face with a network of small red veins all over it, and yellow
whites to her pale blue eyes. She took a fancy to Philip and called him by his
Christian name before he had been in the shop a week.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve both known what it is to come down,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
She told Philip that her real name was not Hodges, but she always referred to
&ldquo;me &rsquo;usband Misterodges;&rdquo; he was a barrister and he treated
her simply shocking, so she left him as she preferred to be independent like;
but she had known what it was to drive in her own carriage, dear&mdash;she
called everyone dear&mdash;and they always had late dinner at home. She used to
pick her teeth with the pin of an enormous silver brooch. It was in the form of
a whip and a hunting-crop crossed, with two spurs in the middle. Philip was ill
at ease in his new surroundings, and the girls in the shop called him
&lsquo;sidey.&rsquo; One addressed him as Phil, and he did not answer because
he had not the least idea that she was speaking to him; so she tossed her head,
saying he was a &lsquo;stuck-up thing,&rsquo; and next time with ironical
emphasis called him Mister Carey. She was a Miss Jewell, and she was going to
marry a doctor. The other girls had never seen him, but they said he must be a
gentleman as he gave her such lovely presents.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never you mind what they say, dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hodges.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad to go through it same as you &rsquo;ave. They
don&rsquo;t know any better, poor things. You take my word for it,
they&rsquo;ll like you all right if you &rsquo;old your own same as I
&rsquo;ave.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The social evening was held in the restaurant in the basement. The tables were
put on one side so that there might be room for dancing, and smaller ones were
set out for progressive whist.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The &rsquo;eads &rsquo;ave to get there early,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hodges.
</p>

<p>
She introduced him to Miss Bennett, who was the belle of Lynn&rsquo;s. She was
the buyer in the &lsquo;Petticoats,&rsquo; and when Philip entered was engaged
in conversation with the buyer in the &lsquo;Gentlemen&rsquo;s Hosiery;&rsquo;
Miss Bennett was a woman of massive proportions, with a very large red face
heavily powdered and a bust of imposing dimensions; her flaxen hair was
arranged with elaboration. She was overdressed, but not badly dressed, in black
with a high collar, and she wore black glace gloves, in which she played cards;
she had several heavy gold chains round her neck, bangles on her wrists, and
circular photograph pendants, one being of Queen Alexandra; she carried a black
satin bag and chewed Sen-sens.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Please to meet you, Mr. Carey,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This is your
first visit to our social evenings, ain&rsquo;t it? I expect you feel a bit
shy, but there&rsquo;s no cause to, I promise you that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She did her best to make people feel at home. She slapped them on the shoulders
and laughed a great deal.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t I a pickle?&rdquo; she cried, turning to Philip. &ldquo;What
must you think of me? But I can&rsquo;t &rsquo;elp meself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Those who were going to take part in the social evening came in, the younger
members of the staff mostly, boys who had not girls of their own, and girls who
had not yet found anyone to walk with. Several of the young gentlemen wore
lounge suits with white evening ties and red silk handkerchiefs; they were
going to perform, and they had a busy, abstracted air; some were
self-confident, but others were nervous, and they watched their public with an
anxious eye. Presently a girl with a great deal of hair sat at the piano and
ran her hands noisily across the keyboard. When the audience had settled itself
she looked round and gave the name of her piece.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A Drive in Russia.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a round of clapping during which she deftly fixed bells to her
wrists. She smiled a little and immediately burst into energetic melody. There
was a great deal more clapping when she finished, and when this was over, as an
encore, she gave a piece which imitated the sea; there were little trills to
represent the lapping waves and thundering chords, with the loud pedal down, to
suggest a storm. After this a gentleman sang a song called Bid me Good-bye, and
as an encore obliged with Sing me to Sleep. The audience measured their
enthusiasm with a nice discrimination. Everyone was applauded till he gave an
encore, and so that there might be no jealousy no one was applauded more than
anyone else. Miss Bennett sailed up to Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you play or sing, Mr. Carey,&rdquo; she said archly.
&ldquo;I can see it in your face.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you even recite?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have no parlour tricks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The buyer in the &lsquo;gentleman&rsquo;s hosiery&rsquo; was a well-known
reciter, and he was called upon loudly to perform by all the assistants in his
department. Needing no pressing, he gave a long poem of tragic character, in
which he rolled his eyes, put his hand on his chest, and acted as though he
were in great agony. The point, that he had eaten cucumber for supper, was
divulged in the last line and was greeted with laughter, a little forced
because everyone knew the poem well, but loud and long. Miss Bennett did not
sing, play, or recite.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, she &rsquo;as a little game of her own,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hodges.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t you begin chaffing me. The fact is I know quite a lot
about palmistry and second sight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, do tell my &rsquo;and, Miss Bennett,&rdquo; cried the girls in her
department, eager to please her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like telling &rsquo;ands, I don&rsquo;t really. I&rsquo;ve
told people such terrible things and they&rsquo;ve all come true, it makes one
superstitious like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Miss Bennett, just for once.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A little crowd collected round her, and, amid screams of embarrassment,
giggles, blushings, and cries of dismay or admiration, she talked mysteriously
of fair and dark men, of money in a letter, and of journeys, till the sweat
stood in heavy beads on her painted face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all of a
perspiration.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Supper was at nine. There were cakes, buns, sandwiches, tea and coffee, all
free; but if you wanted mineral water you had to pay for it. Gallantry often
led young men to offer the ladies ginger beer, but common decency made them
refuse. Miss Bennett was very fond of ginger beer, and she drank two and
sometimes three bottles during the evening; but she insisted on paying for them
herself. The men liked her for that.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a rum old bird,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;but mind you,
she&rsquo;s not a bad sort, she&rsquo;s not like what some are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
After supper progressive whist was played. This was very noisy, and there was a
great deal of laughing and shouting, as people moved from table to table. Miss
Bennett grew hotter and hotter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all of a
perspiration.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In due course one of the more dashing of the young men remarked that if they
wanted to dance they&rsquo;d better begin. The girl who had played the
accompaniments sat at the piano and placed a decided foot on the loud pedal.
She played a dreamy waltz, marking the time with the bass, while with the right
hand she &lsquo;tiddled&rsquo; in alternate octaves. By way of a change she
crossed her hands and played the air in the bass.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She does play well, doesn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Mrs. Hodges remarked to
Philip. &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s more she&rsquo;s never &rsquo;ad a lesson in
&rsquo;er life; it&rsquo;s all ear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Miss Bennett liked dancing and poetry better than anything in the world. She
danced well, but very, very slowly, and an expression came into her eyes as
though her thoughts were far, far away. She talked breathlessly of the floor
and the heat and the supper. She said that the Portman Rooms had the best floor
in London and she always liked the dances there; they were very select, and she
couldn&rsquo;t bear dancing with all sorts of men you didn&rsquo;t know
anything about; why, you might be exposing yourself to you didn&rsquo;t know
what all. Nearly all the people danced very well, and they enjoyed themselves.
Sweat poured down their faces, and the very high collars of the young men grew
limp.
</p>

<p>
Philip looked on, and a greater depression seized him than he remembered to
have felt for a long time. He felt intolerably alone. He did not go, because he
was afraid to seem supercilious, and he talked with the girls and laughed, but
in his heart was unhappiness. Miss Bennett asked him if he had a girl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, well, there&rsquo;s plenty to choose from here. And they&rsquo;re
very nice respectable girls, some of them. I expect you&rsquo;ll have a girl
before you&rsquo;ve been here long.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked at him very archly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Meet &rsquo;em &rsquo;alf-way,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hodges.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I tell him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was nearly eleven o&rsquo;clock, and the party broke up. Philip could not
get to sleep. Like the others he kept his aching feet outside the bed-clothes.
He tried with all his might not to think of the life he was leading. The
soldier was snoring quietly.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>CV</h2>

<p>
The wages were paid once a month by the secretary. On pay-day each batch of
assistants, coming down from tea, went into the passage and joined the long
line of people waiting orderly like the audience in a queue outside a gallery
door. One by one they entered the office. The secretary sat at a desk with
wooden bowls of money in front of him, and he asked the employe&rsquo;s name;
he referred to a book, quickly, after a suspicious glance at the assistant,
said aloud the sum due, and taking money out of the bowl counted it into his
hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Next.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; was the reply.
</p>

<p>
The assistant passed on to the second secretary and before leaving the room
paid him four shillings for washing money, two shillings for the club, and any
fines that he might have incurred. With what he had left he went back into his
department and there waited till it was time to go. Most of the men in
Philip&rsquo;s house were in debt with the woman who sold the sandwiches they
generally ate for supper. She was a funny old thing, very fat, with a broad,
red face, and black hair plastered neatly on each side of the forehead in the
fashion shown in early pictures of Queen Victoria. She always wore a little
black bonnet and a white apron; her sleeves were tucked up to the elbow; she
cut the sandwiches with large, dirty, greasy hands; and there was grease on her
bodice, grease on her apron, grease on her skirt. She was called Mrs. Fletcher,
but everyone addressed her as &lsquo;Ma&rsquo;; she was really fond of the shop
assistants, whom she called her boys; she never minded giving credit towards
the end of the month, and it was known that now and then she had lent someone
or other a few shillings when he was in straits. She was a good woman. When
they were leaving or when they came back from the holidays, the boys kissed her
fat red cheek; and more than one, dismissed and unable to find another job, had
got for nothing food to keep body and soul together. The boys were sensible of
her large heart and repaid her with genuine affection. There was a story they
liked to tell of a man who had done well for himself at Bradford, and had five
shops of his own, and had come back after fifteen years and visited Ma Fletcher
and given her a gold watch.
</p>

<p>
Philip found himself with eighteen shillings left out of his month&rsquo;s pay.
It was the first money he had ever earned in his life. It gave him none of the
pride which might have been expected, but merely a feeling of dismay. The
smallness of the sum emphasised the hopelessness of his position. He took
fifteen shillings to Mrs. Athelny to pay back part of what he owed her, but she
would not take more than half a sovereign.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you know, at that rate it&rsquo;ll take me eight months to
settle up with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As long as Athelny&rsquo;s in work I can afford to wait, and who knows,
p&rsquo;raps they&rsquo;ll give you a rise.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Athelny kept on saying that he would speak to the manager about Philip, it was
absurd that no use should be made of his talents; but he did nothing, and
Philip soon came to the conclusion that the press-agent was not a person of so
much importance in the manager&rsquo;s eyes as in his own. Occasionally he saw
Athelny in the shop. His flamboyance was extinguished; and in neat,
commonplace, shabby clothes he hurried, a subdued, unassuming little man,
through the departments as though anxious to escape notice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When I think of how I&rsquo;m wasted there,&rdquo; he said at home,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost tempted to give in my notice. There&rsquo;s no scope
for a man like me. I&rsquo;m stunted, I&rsquo;m starved.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Athelny, quietly sewing, took no notice of his complaints. Her mouth
tightened a little.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very hard to get jobs in these times. It&rsquo;s regular and
it&rsquo;s safe; I expect you&rsquo;ll stay there as long as you give
satisfaction.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was evident that Athelny would. It was interesting to see the ascendency
which the uneducated woman, bound to him by no legal tie, had acquired over the
brilliant, unstable man. Mrs. Athelny treated Philip with motherly kindness now
that he was in a different position, and he was touched by her anxiety that he
should make a good meal. It was the solace of his life (and when he grew used
to it, the monotony of it was what chiefly appalled him) that he could go every
Sunday to that friendly house. It was a joy to sit in the stately Spanish
chairs and discuss all manner of things with Athelny. Though his condition
seemed so desperate he never left him to go back to Harrington Street without a
feeling of exultation. At first Philip, in order not to forget what he had
learned, tried to go on reading his medical books, but he found it useless; he
could not fix his attention on them after the exhausting work of the day; and
it seemed hopeless to continue working when he did not know in how long he
would be able to go back to the hospital. He dreamed constantly that he was in
the wards. The awakening was painful. The sensation of other people sleeping in
the room was inexpressibly irksome to him; he had been used to solitude, and to
be with others always, never to be by himself for an instant was at these
moments horrible to him. It was then that he found it most difficult to combat
his despair. He saw himself going on with that life, first to the right, second
on the left, madam, indefinitely; and having to be thankful if he was not sent
away: the men who had gone to the war would be coming home soon, the firm had
guaranteed to take them back, and this must mean that others would be sacked;
he would have to stir himself even to keep the wretched post he had.
</p>

<p>
There was only one thing to free him and that was the death of his uncle. He
would get a few hundred pounds then, and on this he could finish his course at
the hospital. Philip began to wish with all his might for the old man&rsquo;s
death. He reckoned out how long he could possibly live: he was well over
seventy, Philip did not know his exact age, but he must be at least
seventy-five; he suffered from chronic bronchitis and every winter had a bad
cough. Though he knew them by heart Philip read over and over again the details
in his text-book of medicine of chronic bronchitis in the old. A severe winter
might be too much for the old man. With all his heart Philip longed for cold
and rain. He thought of it constantly, so that it became a monomania. Uncle
William was affected by the great heat too, and in August they had three weeks
of sweltering weather. Philip imagined to himself that one day perhaps a
telegram would come saying that the Vicar had died suddenly, and he pictured to
himself his unutterable relief. As he stood at the top of the stairs and
directed people to the departments they wanted, he occupied his mind with
thinking incessantly what he would do with the money. He did not know how much
it would be, perhaps no more than five hundred pounds, but even that would be
enough. He would leave the shop at once, he would not bother to give notice, he
would pack his box and go without saying a word to anybody; and then he would
return to the hospital. That was the first thing. Would he have forgotten much?
In six months he could get it all back, and then he would take his three
examinations as soon as he could, midwifery first, then medicine and surgery.
The awful fear seized him that his uncle, notwithstanding his promises, might
leave everything he had to the parish or the church. The thought made Philip
sick. He could not be so cruel. But if that happened Philip was quite
determined what to do, he would not go on in that way indefinitely; his life
was only tolerable because he could look forward to something better. If he had
no hope he would have no fear. The only brave thing to do then would be to
commit suicide, and, thinking this over too, Philip decided minutely what
painless drug he would take and how he would get hold of it. It encouraged him
to think that, if things became unendurable, he had at all events a way out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Second to the right, madam, and down the stairs. First on the left and
straight through. Mr. Philips, forward please.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Once a month, for a week, Philip was &lsquo;on duty.&rsquo; He had to go to the
department at seven in the morning and keep an eye on the sweepers. When they
finished he had to take the sheets off the cases and the models. Then, in the
evening when the assistants left, he had to put back the sheets on the models
and the cases and &lsquo;gang&rsquo; the sweepers again. It was a dusty, dirty
job. He was not allowed to read or write or smoke, but just had to walk about,
and the time hung heavily on his hands. When he went off at half past nine he
had supper given him, and this was the only consolation; for tea at five
o&rsquo;clock had left him with a healthy appetite, and the bread and cheese,
the abundant cocoa which the firm provided, were welcome.
</p>

<p>
One day when Philip had been at Lynn&rsquo;s for three months, Mr. Sampson, the
buyer, came into the department, fuming with anger. The manager, happening to
notice the costume window as he came in, had sent for the buyer and made
satirical remarks upon the colour scheme. Forced to submit in silence to his
superior&rsquo;s sarcasm, Mr. Sampson took it out of the assistants; and he
rated the wretched fellow whose duty it was to dress the window.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you want a thing well done you must do it yourself,&rdquo; Mr.
Sampson stormed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always said it and I always shall. One
can&rsquo;t leave anything to you chaps. Intelligent you call yourselves, do
you? Intelligent!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He threw the word at the assistants as though it were the bitterest term of
reproach.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that if you put an electric blue in the window
it&rsquo;ll kill all the other blues?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked round the department ferociously, and his eye fell upon Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll dress the window next Friday, Carey. Let&rsquo;s see what
you can make of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He went into his office, muttering angrily. Philip&rsquo;s heart sank. When
Friday morning came he went into the window with a sickening sense of shame.
His cheeks were burning. It was horrible to display himself to the passers-by,
and though he told himself it was foolish to give way to such a feeling he
turned his back to the street. There was not much chance that any of the
students at the hospital would pass along Oxford Street at that hour, and he
knew hardly anyone else in London; but as Philip worked, with a huge lump in
his throat, he fancied that on turning round he would catch the eye of some man
he knew. He made all the haste he could. By the simple observation that all
reds went together, and by spacing the costumes more than was usual, Philip got
a very good effect; and when the buyer went into the street to look at the
result he was obviously pleased.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I knew I shouldn&rsquo;t go far wrong in putting you on the window. The
fact is, you and me are gentlemen, mind you I wouldn&rsquo;t say this in the
department, but you and me are gentlemen, and that always tells. It&rsquo;s no
good your telling me it doesn&rsquo;t tell, because I know it does tell.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was put on the job regularly, but he could not accustom himself to the
publicity; and he dreaded Friday morning, on which the window was dressed, with
a terror that made him awake at five o&rsquo;clock and lie sleepless with
sickness in his heart. The girls in the department noticed his shamefaced way,
and they very soon discovered his trick of standing with his back to the
street. They laughed at him and called him &lsquo;sidey.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re afraid your aunt&rsquo;ll come along and cut you
out of her will.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
On the whole he got on well enough with the girls. They thought him a little
queer; but his club-foot seemed to excuse his not being like the rest, and they
found in due course that he was good-natured. He never minded helping anyone,
and he was polite and even tempered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can see he&rsquo;s a gentleman,&rdquo; they said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very reserved, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; said one young woman, to whose
passionate enthusiasm for the theatre he had listened unmoved.
</p>

<p>
Most of them had &lsquo;fellers,&rsquo; and those who hadn&rsquo;t said they
had rather than have it supposed that no one had an inclination for them. One
or two showed signs of being willing to start a flirtation with Philip, and he
watched their manoeuvres with grave amusement. He had had enough of love-making
for some time; and he was nearly always tired and often hungry.
</p>

<h2>CVI</h2>

<p>
Philip avoided the places he had known in happier times. The little gatherings
at the tavern in Beak Street were broken up: Macalister, having let down his
friends, no longer went there, and Hayward was at the Cape. Only Lawson
remained; and Philip, feeling that now the painter and he had nothing in
common, did not wish to see him; but one Saturday afternoon, after dinner,
having changed his clothes he walked down Regent Street to go to the free
library in St. Martin&rsquo;s Lane, meaning to spend the afternoon there, and
suddenly found himself face to face with him. His first instinct was to pass on
without a word, but Lawson did not give him the opportunity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where on earth have you been all this time?&rdquo; he cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I?&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wrote you and asked you to come to the studio for a beano and you
never even answered.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get your letter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I know. I went to the hospital to ask for you, and I saw my letter
in the rack. Have you chucked the Medical?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip hesitated for a moment. He was ashamed to tell the truth, but the shame
he felt angered him, and he forced himself to speak. He could not help
reddening.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I lost the little money I had. I couldn&rsquo;t afford to go on
with it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, I&rsquo;m awfully sorry. What are you doing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a shop-walker.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The words choked Philip, but he was determined not to shirk the truth. He kept
his eyes on Lawson and saw his embarrassment. Philip smiled savagely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you went into Lynn and Sedley, and made your way into the &lsquo;made
robes&rsquo; department, you would see me in a frock coat, walking about with a
degage air and directing ladies who want to buy petticoats or stockings. First
to the right, madam, and second on the left.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lawson, seeing that Philip was making a jest of it, laughed awkwardly. He did
not know what to say. The picture that Philip called up horrified him, but he
was afraid to show his sympathy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bit of a change for you,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
His words seemed absurd to him, and immediately he wished he had not said them.
Philip flushed darkly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A bit,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;By the way, I owe you five bob.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He put his hand in his pocket and pulled out some silver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I&rsquo;d forgotten all about it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go on, take it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lawson received the money silently. They stood in the middle of the pavement,
and people jostled them as they passed. There was a sardonic twinkle in
Philip&rsquo;s eyes, which made the painter intensely uncomfortable, and he
could not tell that Philip&rsquo;s heart was heavy with despair. Lawson wanted
dreadfully to do something, but he did not know what to do.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, won&rsquo;t you come to the studio and have a talk?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to talk about.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He saw the pain come into Lawson&rsquo;s eyes, he could not help it, he was
sorry, but he had to think of himself; he could not bear the thought of
discussing his situation, he could endure it only by determining resolutely not
to think about it. He was afraid of his weakness if once he began to open his
heart. Moreover, he took irresistible dislikes to the places where he had been
miserable: he remembered the humiliation he had endured when he had waited in
that studio, ravenous with hunger, for Lawson to offer him a meal, and the last
occasion when he had taken the five shillings off him. He hated the sight of
Lawson, because he recalled those days of utter abasement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then look here, come and dine with me one night. Choose your own
evening.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was touched with the painter&rsquo;s kindness. All sorts of people were
strangely kind to him, he thought.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully good of you, old man, but I&rsquo;d rather
not.&rdquo; He held out his hand. &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lawson, troubled by a behaviour which seemed inexplicable, took his hand, and
Philip quickly limped away. His heart was heavy; and, as was usual with him, he
began to reproach himself for what he had done: he did not know what madness of
pride had made him refuse the offered friendship. But he heard someone running
behind him and presently Lawson&rsquo;s voice calling him; he stopped and
suddenly the feeling of hostility got the better of him; he presented to Lawson
a cold, set face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you heard about Hayward, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know he went to the Cape.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He died, you know, soon after landing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
For a moment Philip did not answer. He could hardly believe his ears.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, enteric. Hard luck, wasn&rsquo;t it? I thought you mightn&rsquo;t
know. Gave me a bit of a turn when I heard it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Lawson nodded quickly and walked away. Philip felt a shiver pass through his
heart. He had never before lost a friend of his own age, for the death of
Cronshaw, a man so much older than himself, had seemed to come in the normal
course of things. The news gave him a peculiar shock. It reminded him of his
own mortality, for like everyone else Philip, knowing perfectly that all men
must die, had no intimate feeling that the same must apply to himself; and
Hayward&rsquo;s death, though he had long ceased to have any warm feeling for
him, affected him deeply. He remembered on a sudden all the good talks they had
had, and it pained him to think that they would never talk with one another
again; he remembered their first meeting and the pleasant months they had spent
together in Heidelberg. Philip&rsquo;s heart sank as he thought of the lost
years. He walked on mechanically, not noticing where he went, and realised
suddenly, with a movement of irritation, that instead of turning down the
Haymarket he had sauntered along Shaftesbury Avenue. It bored him to retrace
his steps; and besides, with that news, he did not want to read, he wanted to
sit alone and think. He made up his mind to go to the British Museum. Solitude
was now his only luxury. Since he had been at Lynn&rsquo;s he had often gone
there and sat in front of the groups from the Parthenon; and, not deliberately
thinking, had allowed their divine masses to rest his troubled soul. But this
afternoon they had nothing to say to him, and after a few minutes, impatiently,
he wandered out of the room. There were too many people, provincials with
foolish faces, foreigners poring over guide-books; their hideousness besmirched
the everlasting masterpieces, their restlessness troubled the god&rsquo;s
immortal repose. He went into another room and here there was hardly anyone.
Philip sat down wearily. His nerves were on edge. He could not get the people
out of his mind. Sometimes at Lynn&rsquo;s they affected him in the same way,
and he looked at them file past him with horror; they were so ugly and there
was such meanness in their faces, it was terrifying; their features were
distorted with paltry desires, and you felt they were strange to any ideas of
beauty. They had furtive eyes and weak chins. There was no wickedness in them,
but only pettiness and vulgarity. Their humour was a low facetiousness.
Sometimes he found himself looking at them to see what animal they resembled
(he tried not to, for it quickly became an obsession,) and he saw in them all
the sheep or the horse or the fox or the goat. Human beings filled him with
disgust.
</p>

<p>
But presently the influence of the place descended upon him. He felt quieter.
He began to look absently at the tombstones with which the room was lined. They
were the work of Athenian stone masons of the fourth and fifth centuries before
Christ, and they were very simple, work of no great talent but with the
exquisite spirit of Athens upon them; time had mellowed the marble to the
colour of honey, so that unconsciously one thought of the bees of Hymettus, and
softened their outlines. Some represented a nude figure, seated on a bench,
some the departure of the dead from those who loved him, and some the dead
clasping hands with one who remained behind. On all was the tragic word
farewell; that and nothing more. Their simplicity was infinitely touching.
Friend parted from friend, the son from his mother, and the restraint made the
survivor&rsquo;s grief more poignant. It was so long, long ago, and century
upon century had passed over that unhappiness; for two thousand years those who
wept had been dust as those they wept for. Yet the woe was alive still, and it
filled Philip&rsquo;s heart so that he felt compassion spring up in it, and he
said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor things, poor things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And it came to him that the gaping sight-seers and the fat strangers with their
guide-books, and all those mean, common people who thronged the shop, with
their trivial desires and vulgar cares, were mortal and must die. They too
loved and must part from those they loved, the son from his mother, the wife
from her husband; and perhaps it was more tragic because their lives were ugly
and sordid, and they knew nothing that gave beauty to the world. There was one
stone which was very beautiful, a bas relief of two young men holding each
other&rsquo;s hand; and the reticence of line, the simplicity, made one like to
think that the sculptor here had been touched with a genuine emotion. It was an
exquisite memorial to that than which the world offers but one thing more
precious, to a friendship; and as Philip looked at it, he felt the tears come
to his eyes. He thought of Hayward and his eager admiration for him when first
they met, and how disillusion had come and then indifference, till nothing held
them together but habit and old memories. It was one of the queer things of
life that you saw a person every day for months and were so intimate with him
that you could not imagine existence without him; then separation came, and
everything went on in the same way, and the companion who had seemed essential
proved unnecessary. Your life proceeded and you did not even miss him. Philip
thought of those early days in Heidelberg when Hayward, capable of great
things, had been full of enthusiasm for the future, and how, little by little,
achieving nothing, he had resigned himself to failure. Now he was dead. His
death had been as futile as his life. He died ingloriously, of a stupid
disease, failing once more, even at the end, to accomplish anything. It was
just the same now as if he had never lived.
</p>

<p>
Philip asked himself desperately what was the use of living at all. It all
seemed inane. It was the same with Cronshaw: it was quite unimportant that he
had lived; he was dead and forgotten, his book of poems sold in remainder by
second-hand booksellers; his life seemed to have served nothing except to give
a pushing journalist occasion to write an article in a review. And Philip cried
out in his soul:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is the use of it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The effort was so incommensurate with the result. The bright hopes of youth had
to be paid for at such a bitter price of disillusionment. Pain and disease and
unhappiness weighed down the scale so heavily. What did it all mean? He thought
of his own life, the high hopes with which he had entered upon it, the
limitations which his body forced upon him, his friendlessness, and the lack of
affection which had surrounded his youth. He did not know that he had ever done
anything but what seemed best to do, and what a cropper he had come! Other men,
with no more advantages than he, succeeded, and others again, with many more,
failed. It seemed pure chance. The rain fell alike upon the just and upon the
unjust, and for nothing was there a why and a wherefore.
</p>

<p>
Thinking of Cronshaw, Philip remembered the Persian rug which he had given him,
telling him that it offered an answer to his question upon the meaning of life;
and suddenly the answer occurred to him: he chuckled: now that he had it, it
was like one of the puzzles which you worry over till you are shown the
solution and then cannot imagine how it could ever have escaped you. The answer
was obvious. Life had no meaning. On the earth, satellite of a star speeding
through space, living things had arisen under the influence of conditions which
were part of the planet&rsquo;s history; and as there had been a beginning of
life upon it so, under the influence of other conditions, there would be an
end: man, no more significant than other forms of life, had come not as the
climax of creation but as a physical reaction to the environment. Philip
remembered the story of the Eastern King who, desiring to know the history of
man, was brought by a sage five hundred volumes; busy with affairs of state, he
bade him go and condense it; in twenty years the sage returned and his history
now was in no more than fifty volumes, but the King, too old then to read so
many ponderous tomes, bade him go and shorten it once more; twenty years passed
again and the sage, old and gray, brought a single book in which was the
knowledge the King had sought; but the King lay on his death-bed, and he had no
time to read even that; and then the sage gave him the history of man in a
single line; it was this: he was born, he suffered, and he died. There was no
meaning in life, and man by living served no end. It was immaterial whether he
was born or not born, whether he lived or ceased to live. Life was
insignificant and death without consequence. Philip exulted, as he had exulted
in his boyhood when the weight of a belief in God was lifted from his
shoulders: it seemed to him that the last burden of responsibility was taken
from him; and for the first time he was utterly free. His insignificance was
turned to power, and he felt himself suddenly equal with the cruel fate which
had seemed to persecute him; for, if life was meaningless, the world was robbed
of its cruelty. What he did or left undone did not matter. Failure was
unimportant and success amounted to nothing. He was the most inconsiderate
creature in that swarming mass of mankind which for a brief space occupied the
surface of the earth; and he was almighty because he had wrenched from chaos
the secret of its nothingness. Thoughts came tumbling over one another in
Philip&rsquo;s eager fancy, and he took long breaths of joyous satisfaction. He
felt inclined to leap and sing. He had not been so happy for months.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, life,&rdquo; he cried in his heart, &ldquo;Oh life, where is thy
sting?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
For the same uprush of fancy which had shown him with all the force of
mathematical demonstration that life had no meaning, brought with it another
idea; and that was why Cronshaw, he imagined, had given him the Persian rug. As
the weaver elaborated his pattern for no end but the pleasure of his aesthetic
sense, so might a man live his life, or if one was forced to believe that his
actions were outside his choosing, so might a man look at his life, that it
made a pattern. There was as little need to do this as there was use. It was
merely something he did for his own pleasure. Out of the manifold events of his
life, his deeds, his feelings, his thoughts, he might make a design, regular,
elaborate, complicated, or beautiful; and though it might be no more than an
illusion that he had the power of selection, though it might be no more than a
fantastic legerdemain in which appearances were interwoven with moonbeams, that
did not matter: it seemed, and so to him it was. In the vast warp of life (a
river arising from no spring and flowing endlessly to no sea), with the
background to his fancies that there was no meaning and that nothing was
important, a man might get a personal satisfaction in selecting the various
strands that worked out the pattern. There was one pattern, the most obvious,
perfect, and beautiful, in which a man was born, grew to manhood, married,
produced children, toiled for his bread, and died; but there were others,
intricate and wonderful, in which happiness did not enter and in which success
was not attempted; and in them might be discovered a more troubling grace. Some
lives, and Hayward&rsquo;s was among them, the blind indifference of chance cut
off while the design was still imperfect; and then the solace was comfortable
that it did not matter; other lives, such as Cronshaw&rsquo;s, offered a
pattern which was difficult to follow, the point of view had to be shifted and
old standards had to be altered before one could understand that such a life
was its own justification. Philip thought that in throwing over the desire for
happiness he was casting aside the last of his illusions. His life had seemed
horrible when it was measured by its happiness, but now he seemed to gather
strength as he realised that it might be measured by something else. Happiness
mattered as little as pain. They came in, both of them, as all the other
details of his life came in, to the elaboration of the design. He seemed for an
instant to stand above the accidents of his existence, and he felt that they
could not affect him again as they had done before. Whatever happened to him
now would be one more motive to add to the complexity of the pattern, and when
the end approached he would rejoice in its completion. It would be a work of
art, and it would be none the less beautiful because he alone knew of its
existence, and with his death it would at once cease to be.
</p>

<p>
Philip was happy.

<h2>CVII</h2>

<p>
Mr. Sampson, the buyer, took a fancy to Philip. Mr. Sampson was very dashing,
and the girls in his department said they would not be surprised if he married
one of the rich customers. He lived out of town and often impressed the
assistants by putting on his evening clothes in the office. Sometimes he would
be seen by those on sweeping duty coming in next morning still dressed, and
they would wink gravely to one another while he went into his office and
changed into a frock coat. On these occasions, having slipped out for a hurried
breakfast, he also would wink at Philip as he walked up the stairs on his way
back and rub his hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a night! What a night!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My word!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He told Philip that he was the only gentleman there, and he and Philip were the
only fellows who knew what life was. Having said this, he changed his manner
suddenly, called Philip Mr. Carey instead of old boy, assumed the importance
due to his position as buyer, and put Philip back into his place of
shop-walker.
</p>

<p>
Lynn and Sedley received fashion papers from Paris once a week and adapted the
costumes illustrated in them to the needs of their customers. Their clientele
was peculiar. The most substantial part consisted of women from the smaller
manufacturing towns, who were too elegant to have their frocks made locally and
not sufficiently acquainted with London to discover good dressmakers within
their means. Beside these, incongruously, was a large number of music-hall
artistes. This was a connection that Mr. Sampson had worked up for himself and
took great pride in. They had begun by getting their stage-costumes at
Lynn&rsquo;s, and he had induced many of them to get their other clothes there
as well.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As good as Paquin and half the price,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
He had a persuasive, hail-fellow well-met air with him which appealed to
customers of this sort, and they said to one another:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of throwing money away when you can get a coat and
skirt at Lynn&rsquo;s that nobody knows don&rsquo;t come from Paris?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Sampson was very proud of his friendship with the popular favourites whose
frocks he made, and when he went out to dinner at two o&rsquo;clock on Sunday
with Miss Victoria Virgo&mdash;&ldquo;she was wearing that powder blue we made
her and I lay she didn&rsquo;t let on it come from us, I &rsquo;ad to tell her
meself that if I &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t designed it with my own &rsquo;ands
I&rsquo;d have said it must come from Paquin&rdquo;&mdash;at her beautiful
house in Tulse Hill, he regaled the department next day with abundant details.
Philip had never paid much attention to women&rsquo;s clothes, but in course of
time he began, a little amused at himself, to take a technical interest in
them. He had an eye for colour which was more highly trained than that of
anyone in the department, and he had kept from his student days in Paris some
knowledge of line. Mr. Sampson, an ignorant man conscious of his incompetence,
but with a shrewdness that enabled him to combine other people&rsquo;s
suggestions, constantly asked the opinion of the assistants in his department
in making up new designs; and he had the quickness to see that Philip&rsquo;s
criticisms were valuable. But he was very jealous, and would never allow that
he took anyone&rsquo;s advice. When he had altered some drawing in accordance
with Philip&rsquo;s suggestion, he always finished up by saying:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, it comes round to my own idea in the end.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
One day, when Philip had been at the shop for five months, Miss Alice Antonia,
the well-known serio-comic, came in and asked to see Mr. Sampson. She was a
large woman, with flaxen hair, and a boldly painted face, a metallic voice, and
the breezy manner of a comedienne accustomed to be on friendly terms with the
gallery boys of provincial music-halls. She had a new song and wished Mr.
Sampson to design a costume for her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want something striking,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
any old thing you know. I want something different from what anybody else
has.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Sampson, bland and familiar, said he was quite certain they could get her
the very thing she required. He showed her sketches.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know there&rsquo;s nothing here that would do, but I just want to show
you the kind of thing I would suggest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, that&rsquo;s not the sort of thing at all,&rdquo; she said, as
she glanced at them impatiently. &ldquo;What I want is something that&rsquo;ll
just hit &rsquo;em in the jaw and make their front teeth rattle.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I quite understand, Miss Antonia,&rdquo; said the buyer, with a
bland smile, but his eyes grew blank and stupid.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I expect I shall &rsquo;ave to pop over to Paris for it in the
end.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I think we can give you satisfaction, Miss Antonia. What you can get
in Paris you can get here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When she had swept out of the department Mr. Sampson, a little worried,
discussed the matter with Mrs. Hodges.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a caution and no mistake,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hodges.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Alice, where art thou?&rdquo; remarked the buyer, irritably, and thought
he had scored a point against her.
</p>

<p>
His ideas of music-hall costumes had never gone beyond short skirts, a swirl of
lace, and glittering sequins; but Miss Antonia had expressed herself on that
subject in no uncertain terms.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my aunt!&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
And the invocation was uttered in such a tone as to indicate a rooted antipathy
to anything so commonplace, even if she had not added that sequins gave her the
sick. Mr. Sampson &lsquo;got out&rsquo; one or two ideas, but Mrs. Hodges told
him frankly she did not think they would do. It was she who gave Philip the
suggestion:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can you draw, Phil? Why don&rsquo;t you try your &lsquo;and and see what
you can do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip bought a cheap box of water colours, and in the evening while Bell, the
noisy lad of sixteen, whistling three notes, busied himself with his stamps, he
made one or two sketches. He remembered some of the costumes he had seen in
Paris, and he adapted one of them, getting his effect from a combination of
violent, unusual colours. The result amused him and next morning he showed it
to Mrs. Hodges. She was somewhat astonished, but took it at once to the buyer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unusual,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no denying
that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It puzzled him, and at the same time his trained eye saw that it would make up
admirably. To save his face he began making suggestions for altering it, but
Mrs. Hodges, with more sense, advised him to show it to Miss Antonia as it was.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s neck or nothing with her, and she may take a fancy to
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good deal more nothing than neck,&rdquo; said Mr. Sampson,
looking at the decolletage. &ldquo;He can draw, can&rsquo;t he? Fancy &rsquo;im
keeping it dark all this time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When Miss Antonia was announced, the buyer placed the design on the table in
such a position that it must catch her eye the moment she was shown into his
office. She pounced on it at once.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I &rsquo;ave
that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just an idea we got out for you,&rdquo; said Mr. Sampson
casually. &ldquo;D&rsquo;you like it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do I like it!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Give me &rsquo;alf a pint with a
little drop of gin in it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, you see, you don&rsquo;t have to go to Paris. You&rsquo;ve only got
to say what you want and there you are.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The work was put in hand at once, and Philip felt quite a thrill of
satisfaction when he saw the costume completed. The buyer and Mrs. Hodges took
all the credit of it; but he did not care, and when he went with them to the
Tivoli to see Miss Antonia wear it for the first time he was filled with
elation. In answer to her questions he at last told Mrs. Hodges how he had
learnt to draw&mdash;fearing that the people he lived with would think he
wanted to put on airs, he had always taken the greatest care to say nothing
about his past occupations&mdash;and she repeated the information to Mr.
Sampson. The buyer said nothing to him on the subject, but began to treat him a
little more deferentially and presently gave him designs to do for two of the
country customers. They met with satisfaction. Then he began to speak to his
clients of a &ldquo;clever young feller, Paris art-student, you know,&rdquo;
who worked for him; and soon Philip, ensconced behind a screen, in his shirt
sleeves, was drawing from morning till night. Sometimes he was so busy that he
had to dine at three with the &lsquo;stragglers.&rsquo; He liked it, because
there were few of them and they were all too tired to talk; the food also was
better, for it consisted of what was left over from the buyers&rsquo; table.
Philip&rsquo;s rise from shop-walker to designer of costumes had a great effect
on the department. He realised that he was an object of envy. Harris, the
assistant with the queer-shaped head, who was the first person he had known at
the shop and had attached himself to Philip, could not conceal his bitterness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Some people &rsquo;ave all the luck,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
be a buyer yourself one of these days, and we shall all be calling you
sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He told Philip that he should demand higher wages, for notwithstanding the
difficult work he was now engaged in, he received no more than the six
shillings a week with which he started. But it was a ticklish matter to ask for
a rise. The manager had a sardonic way of dealing with such applicants.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Think you&rsquo;re worth more, do you? How much d&rsquo;you think
you&rsquo;re worth, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The assistant, with his heart in his mouth, would suggest that he thought he
ought to have another two shillings a week.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, very well, if you think you&rsquo;re worth it. You can &rsquo;ave
it.&rdquo; Then he paused and sometimes, with a steely eye, added: &ldquo;And
you can &rsquo;ave your notice too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was no use then to withdraw your request, you had to go. The manager&rsquo;s
idea was that assistants who were dissatisfied did not work properly, and if
they were not worth a rise it was better to sack them at once. The result was
that they never asked for one unless they were prepared to leave. Philip
hesitated. He was a little suspicious of the men in his room who told him that
the buyer could not do without him. They were decent fellows, but their sense
of humour was primitive, and it would have seemed funny to them if they had
persuaded Philip to ask for more wages and he were sacked. He could not forget
the mortification he had suffered in looking for work, he did not wish to
expose himself to that again, and he knew there was small chance of his getting
elsewhere a post as designer: there were hundreds of people about who could
draw as well as he. But he wanted money very badly; his clothes were worn out,
and the heavy carpets rotted his socks and boots; he had almost persuaded
himself to take the venturesome step when one morning, passing up from
breakfast in the basement through the passage that led to the manager&rsquo;s
office, he saw a queue of men waiting in answer to an advertisement. There were
about a hundred of them, and whichever was engaged would be offered his keep
and the same six shillings a week that Philip had. He saw some of them cast
envious glances at him because he had employment. It made him shudder. He dared
not risk it.

<h2>CVIII</h2>

<p>
The winter passed. Now and then Philip went to the hospital, slinking in when
it was late and there was little chance of meeting anyone he knew, to see
whether there were letters for him. At Easter he received one from his uncle.
He was surprised to hear from him, for the Vicar of Blackstable had never
written him more than half a dozen letters in his whole life, and they were on
business matters.
</p>

<p>
Dear Philip,
</p>

<p>
If you are thinking of taking a holiday soon and care to come down here I shall
be pleased to see you. I was very ill with my bronchitis in the winter and
Doctor Wigram never expected me to pull through. I have a wonderful
constitution and I made, thank God, a marvellous recovery.<br/>
Yours affectionately,<br/>
William Carey.
</p>

<p>
The letter made Philip angry. How did his uncle think he was living? He did not
even trouble to inquire. He might have starved for all the old man cared. But
as he walked home something struck him; he stopped under a lamp-post and read
the letter again; the handwriting had no longer the business-like firmness
which had characterised it; it was larger and wavering: perhaps the illness had
shaken him more than he was willing to confess, and he sought in that formal
note to express a yearning to see the only relation he had in the world. Philip
wrote back that he could come down to Blackstable for a fortnight in July. The
invitation was convenient, for he had not known what to do, with his brief
holiday. The Athelnys went hopping in September, but he could not then be
spared, since during that month the autumn models were prepared. The rule of
Lynn&rsquo;s was that everyone must take a fortnight whether he wanted it or
not; and during that time, if he had nowhere to go, the assistant might sleep
in his room, but he was not allowed food. A number had no friends within
reasonable distance of London, and to these the holiday was an awkward interval
when they had to provide food out of their small wages and, with the whole day
on their hands, had nothing to spend. Philip had not been out of London since
his visit to Brighton with Mildred, now two years before, and he longed for
fresh air and the silence of the sea. He thought of it with such a passionate
desire, all through May and June, that, when at length the time came for him to
go, he was listless.
</p>

<p>
On his last evening, when he talked with the buyer of one or two jobs he had to
leave over, Mr. Sampson suddenly said to him:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What wages have you been getting?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Six shillings.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s enough. I&rsquo;ll see that you&rsquo;re
put up to twelve when you come back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; smiled Philip. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to
want some new clothes badly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you stick to your work and don&rsquo;t go larking about with the
girls like what some of them do, I&rsquo;ll look after you, Carey. Mind you,
you&rsquo;ve got a lot to learn, but you&rsquo;re promising, I&rsquo;ll say
that for you, you&rsquo;re promising, and I&rsquo;ll see that you get a pound a
week as soon as you deserve it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip wondered how long he would have to wait for that. Two years?
</p>

<p>
He was startled at the change in his uncle. When last he had seen him he was a
stout man, who held himself upright, clean-shaven, with a round, sensual face;
but he had fallen in strangely, his skin was yellow; there were great bags
under the eyes, and he was bent and old. He had grown a beard during his last
illness, and he walked very slowly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at my best today,&rdquo; he said when Philip, having just
arrived, was sitting with him in the dining-room. &ldquo;The heat upsets
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip, asking after the affairs of the parish, looked at him and wondered how
much longer he could last. A hot summer would finish him; Philip noticed how
thin his hands were; they trembled. It meant so much to Philip. If he died that
summer he could go back to the hospital at the beginning of the winter session;
his heart leaped at the thought of returning no more to Lynn&rsquo;s. At dinner
the Vicar sat humped up on his chair, and the housekeeper who had been with him
since his wife&rsquo;s death said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall Mr. Philip carve, sir?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old man, who had been about to do so from disinclination to confess his
weakness, seemed glad at the first suggestion to relinquish the attempt.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a very good appetite,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, I always eat well. But I&rsquo;m thinner than when you were here
last. I&rsquo;m glad to be thinner, I didn&rsquo;t like being so fat. Dr.
Wigram thinks I&rsquo;m all the better for being thinner than I was.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When dinner was over the housekeeper brought him some medicine.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Show the prescription to Master Philip,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a doctor too. I&rsquo;d like him to see that he thinks
it&rsquo;s all right. I told Dr. Wigram that now you&rsquo;re studying to be a
doctor he ought to make a reduction in his charges. It&rsquo;s dreadful the
bills I&rsquo;ve had to pay. He came every day for two months, and he charges
five shillings a visit. It&rsquo;s a lot of money, isn&rsquo;t it? He comes
twice a week still. I&rsquo;m going to tell him he needn&rsquo;t come any more.
I&rsquo;ll send for him if I want him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked at Philip eagerly while he read the prescriptions. They were
narcotics. There were two of them, and one was a medicine which the Vicar
explained he was to use only if his neuritis grew unendurable.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very careful,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get
into the opium habit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He did not mention his nephew&rsquo;s affairs. Philip fancied that it was by
way of precaution, in case he asked for money, that his uncle kept dwelling on
the financial calls upon him. He had spent so much on the doctor and so much
more on the chemist, while he was ill they had had to have a fire every day in
his bed-room, and now on Sunday he needed a carriage to go to church in the
evening as well as in the morning. Philip felt angrily inclined to say he need
not be afraid, he was not going to borrow from him, but he held his tongue. It
seemed to him that everything had left the old man now but two things, pleasure
in his food and a grasping desire for money. It was a hideous old age.
</p>

<p>
In the afternoon Dr. Wigram came, and after the visit Philip walked with him to
the garden gate.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How d&rsquo;you think he is?&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Wigram was more anxious not to do wrong than to do right, and he never
hazarded a definite opinion if he could help it. He had practised at
Blackstable for five-and-thirty years. He had the reputation of being very
safe, and many of his patients thought it much better that a doctor should be
safe than clever. There was a new man at Blackstable&mdash;he had been settled
there for ten years, but they still looked upon him as an interloper&mdash;and
he was said to be very clever; but he had not much practice among the better
people, because no one really knew anything about him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s as well as can be expected,&rdquo; said Dr. Wigram in
answer to Philip&rsquo;s inquiry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has he got anything seriously the matter with him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Philip, your uncle is no longer a young man,&rdquo; said the
doctor with a cautious little smile, which suggested that after all the Vicar
of Blackstable was not an old man either.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He seems to think his heart&rsquo;s in a bad way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not satisfied with his heart,&rdquo; hazarded the doctor,
&ldquo;I think he should be careful, very careful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
On the tip of Philip&rsquo;s tongue was the question: how much longer can he
live? He was afraid it would shock. In these matters a periphrase was demanded
by the decorum of life, but, as he asked another question instead, it flashed
through him that the doctor must be accustomed to the impatience of a sick
man&rsquo;s relatives. He must see through their sympathetic expressions.
Philip, with a faint smile at his own hypocrisy, cast down his eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s in no immediate danger?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was the kind of question the doctor hated. If you said a patient
couldn&rsquo;t live another month the family prepared itself for a bereavement,
and if then the patient lived on they visited the medical attendant with the
resentment they felt at having tormented themselves before it was necessary. On
the other hand, if you said the patient might live a year and he died in a week
the family said you did not know your business. They thought of all the
affection they would have lavished on the defunct if they had known the end was
so near. Dr. Wigram made the gesture of washing his hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any grave risk so long as
he&mdash;remains as he is,&rdquo; he ventured at last. &ldquo;But on the other
hand, we mustn&rsquo;t forget that he&rsquo;s no longer a young man, and well,
the machine is wearing out. If he gets over the hot weather I don&rsquo;t see
why he shouldn&rsquo;t get on very comfortably till the winter, and then if the
winter does not bother him too much, well, I don&rsquo;t see why anything
should happen.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip went back to the dining-room where his uncle was sitting. With his
skull-cap and a crochet shawl over his shoulders he looked grotesque. His eyes
had been fixed on the door, and they rested on Philip&rsquo;s face as he
entered. Philip saw that his uncle had been waiting anxiously for his return.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what did he say about me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip understood suddenly that the old man was frightened of dying. It made
Philip a little ashamed, so that he looked away involuntarily. He was always
embarrassed by the weakness of human nature.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He says he thinks you&rsquo;re much better,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
A gleam of delight came into his uncle&rsquo;s eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a wonderful constitution,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What
else did he say?&rdquo; he added suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
Philip smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He said that if you take care of yourself there&rsquo;s no reason why
you shouldn&rsquo;t live to be a hundred.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I can expect to do that, but I don&rsquo;t see
why I shouldn&rsquo;t see eighty. My mother lived till she was
eighty-four.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a little table by the side of Mr. Carey&rsquo;s chair, and on it were
a Bible and the large volume of the Common Prayer from which for so many years
he had been accustomed to read to his household. He stretched out now his
shaking hand and took his Bible.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Those old patriarchs lived to a jolly good old age, didn&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo; he said, with a queer little laugh in which Philip read a sort of
timid appeal.
</p>

<p>
The old man clung to life. Yet he believed implicitly all that his religion
taught him. He had no doubt in the immortality of the soul, and he felt that he
had conducted himself well enough, according to his capacities, to make it very
likely that he would go to heaven. In his long career to how many dying persons
must he have administered the consolations of religion! Perhaps he was like the
doctor who could get no benefit from his own prescriptions. Philip was puzzled
and shocked by that eager cleaving to the earth. He wondered what nameless
horror was at the back of the old man&rsquo;s mind. He would have liked to
probe into his soul so that he might see in its nakedness the dreadful dismay
of the unknown which he suspected.
</p>

<p>
The fortnight passed quickly and Philip returned to London. He passed a
sweltering August behind his screen in the costumes department, drawing in his
shirt sleeves. The assistants in relays went for their holidays. In the evening
Philip generally went into Hyde Park and listened to the band. Growing more
accustomed to his work it tired him less, and his mind, recovering from its
long stagnation, sought for fresh activity. His whole desire now was set on his
uncle&rsquo;s death. He kept on dreaming the same dream: a telegram was handed
to him one morning, early, which announced the Vicar&rsquo;s sudden demise, and
freedom was in his grasp. When he awoke and found it was nothing but a dream he
was filled with sombre rage. He occupied himself, now that the event seemed
likely to happen at any time, with elaborate plans for the future. In these he
passed rapidly over the year which he must spend before it was possible for him
to be qualified and dwelt on the journey to Spain on which his heart was set.
He read books about that country, which he borrowed from the free library, and
already he knew from photographs exactly what each city looked like. He saw
himself lingering in Cordova on the bridge that spanned the Gaudalquivir; he
wandered through tortuous streets in Toledo and sat in churches where he wrung
from El Greco the secret which he felt the mysterious painter held for him.
Athelny entered into his humour, and on Sunday afternoons they made out
elaborate itineraries so that Philip should miss nothing that was noteworthy.
To cheat his impatience Philip began to teach himself Spanish, and in the
deserted sitting-room in Harrington Street he spent an hour every evening doing
Spanish exercises and puzzling out with an English translation by his side the
magnificent phrases of Don Quixote. Athelny gave him a lesson once a week, and
Philip learned a few sentences to help him on his journey. Mrs. Athelny laughed
at them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You two and your Spanish!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you do
something useful?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Sally, who was growing up and was to put up her hair at Christmas, stood by
sometimes and listened in her grave way while her father and Philip exchanged
remarks in a language she did not understand. She thought her father the most
wonderful man who had ever existed, and she expressed her opinion of Philip
only through her father&rsquo;s commendations.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Father thinks a rare lot of your Uncle Philip,&rdquo; she remarked to
her brothers and sisters.
</p>

<p>
Thorpe, the eldest boy, was old enough to go on the Arethusa, and Athelny
regaled his family with magnificent descriptions of the appearance the lad
would make when he came back in uniform for his holidays. As soon as Sally was
seventeen she was to be apprenticed to a dressmaker. Athelny in his rhetorical
way talked of the birds, strong enough to fly now, who were leaving the
parental nest, and with tears in his eyes told them that the nest would be
there still if ever they wished to return to it. A shakedown and a dinner would
always be theirs, and the heart of a father would never be closed to the
troubles of his children.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You do talk, Athelny,&rdquo; said his wife. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
what trouble they&rsquo;re likely to get into so long as they&rsquo;re steady.
So long as you&rsquo;re honest and not afraid of work you&rsquo;ll never be out
of a job, that&rsquo;s what I think, and I can tell you I shan&rsquo;t be sorry
when I see the last of them earning their own living.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Child-bearing, hard work, and constant anxiety were beginning to tell on Mrs.
Athelny; and sometimes her back ached in the evening so that she had to sit
down and rest herself. Her ideal of happiness was to have a girl to do the
rough work so that she need not herself get up before seven. Athelny waved his
beautiful white hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, my Betty, we&rsquo;ve deserved well of the state, you and I.
We&rsquo;ve reared nine healthy children, and the boys shall serve their king;
the girls shall cook and sew and in their turn breed healthy children.&rdquo;
He turned to Sally, and to comfort her for the anti-climax of the contrast
added grandiloquently: &ldquo;They also serve who only stand and wait.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Athelny had lately added socialism to the other contradictory theories he
vehemently believed in, and he stated now:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In a socialist state we should be richly pensioned, you and I,
Betty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t talk to me about your socialists, I&rsquo;ve got no
patience with them,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It only means that another lot of
lazy loafers will make a good thing out of the working classes. My motto is,
leave me alone; I don&rsquo;t want anyone interfering with me; I&rsquo;ll make
the best of a bad job, and the devil take the hindmost.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you call life a bad job?&rdquo; said Athelny. &ldquo;Never!
We&rsquo;ve had our ups and downs, we&rsquo;ve had our struggles, we&rsquo;ve
always been poor, but it&rsquo;s been worth it, ay, worth it a hundred times I
say when I look round at my children.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You do talk, Athelny,&rdquo; she said, looking at him, not with anger
but with scornful calm. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had the pleasant part of the
children, I&rsquo;ve had the bearing of them, and the bearing with them. I
don&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m not fond of them, now they&rsquo;re there, but
if I had my time over again I&rsquo;d remain single. Why, if I&rsquo;d remained
single I might have a little shop by now, and four or five hundred pounds in
the bank, and a girl to do the rough work. Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t go over my life
again, not for something.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip thought of the countless millions to whom life is no more than unending
labour, neither beautiful nor ugly, but just to be accepted in the same spirit
as one accepts the changes of the seasons. Fury seized him because it all
seemed useless. He could not reconcile himself to the belief that life had no
meaning and yet everything he saw, all his thoughts, added to the force of his
conviction. But though fury seized him it was a joyful fury. Life was not so
horrible if it was meaningless, and he faced it with a strange sense of power.

<h2>CIX</h2>

<p>
The autumn passed into winter. Philip had left his address with Mrs. Foster,
his uncle&rsquo;s housekeeper, so that she might communicate with him, but
still went once a week to the hospital on the chance of there being a letter.
One evening he saw his name on an envelope in a handwriting he had hoped never
to see again. It gave him a queer feeling. For a little while he could not
bring himself to take it. It brought back a host of hateful memories. But at
length, impatient with himself, he ripped open the envelope.
</p>

<p>
7 William Street, Fitzroy Square.
</p>

<p>
Dear Phil,
</p>

<p>
Can I see you for a minute or two as soon as possible. I am in awful trouble
and don&rsquo;t know what to do. It&rsquo;s not money.
</p>

<p>
                                                 Yours truly,<br/>
                                                         Mildred.
</p>

<p>
He tore the letter into little bits and going out into the street scattered
them in the darkness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see her damned,&rdquo; he muttered.
</p>

<p>
A feeling of disgust surged up in him at the thought of seeing her again. He
did not care if she was in distress, it served her right whatever it was, he
thought of her with hatred, and the love he had had for her aroused his
loathing. His recollections filled him with nausea, and as he walked across the
Thames he drew himself aside in an instinctive withdrawal from his thought of
her. He went to bed, but he could not sleep; he wondered what was the matter
with her, and he could not get out of his head the fear that she was ill and
hungry; she would not have written to him unless she were desperate. He was
angry with himself for his weakness, but he knew that he would have no peace
unless he saw her. Next morning he wrote a letter-card and posted it on his way
to the shop. He made it as stiff as he could and said merely that he was sorry
she was in difficulties and would come to the address she had given at seven
o&rsquo;clock that evening.
</p>

<p>
It was that of a shabby lodging-house in a sordid street; and when, sick at the
thought of seeing her, he asked whether she was in, a wild hope seized him that
she had left. It looked the sort of place people moved in and out of
frequently. He had not thought of looking at the postmark on her letter and did
not know how many days it had lain in the rack. The woman who answered the bell
did not reply to his inquiry, but silently preceded him along the passage and
knocked on a door at the back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mrs. Miller, a gentleman to see you,&rdquo; she called.
</p>

<p>
The door was slightly opened, and Mildred looked out suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He walked in and she closed the door. It was a very small bed-room, untidy as
was every place she lived in; there was a pair of shoes on the floor, lying
apart from one another and uncleaned; a hat was on the chest of drawers, with
false curls beside it; and there was a blouse on the table. Philip looked for
somewhere to put his hat. The hooks behind the door were laden with skirts, and
he noticed that they were muddy at the hem.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sit down, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she said. Then she gave a little
awkward laugh. &ldquo;I suppose you were surprised to hear from me
again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re awfully hoarse,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Have you got a
sore throat?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I have had for some time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He did not say anything. He waited for her to explain why she wanted to see
him. The look of the room told him clearly enough that she had gone back to the
life from which he had taken her. He wondered what had happened to the baby;
there was a photograph of it on the chimney-piece, but no sign in the room that
a child was ever there. Mildred was holding her handkerchief. She made it into
a little ball, and passed it from hand to hand. He saw that she was very
nervous. She was staring at the fire, and he could look at her without meeting
her eyes. She was much thinner than when she had left him; and the skin, yellow
and dryish, was drawn more tightly over her cheekbones. She had dyed her hair
and it was now flaxen: it altered her a good deal, and made her look more
vulgar.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was relieved to get your letter, I can tell you,&rdquo; she said at
last. &ldquo;I thought p&rsquo;raps you weren&rsquo;t at the &rsquo;ospital any
more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip did not speak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re qualified by now, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no longer at the hospital. I had to give it up eighteen months
ago.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are changeable. You don&rsquo;t seem as if you could stick to
anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was silent for another moment, and when he went on it was with coldness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I lost the little money I had in an unlucky speculation and I
couldn&rsquo;t afford to go on with the medical. I had to earn my living as
best I could.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you doing then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a shop.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She gave him a quick glance and turned her eyes away at once. He thought that
she reddened. She dabbed her palms nervously with the handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve not forgotten all your doctoring, have you?&rdquo; She
jerked the words out quite oddly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not entirely.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because that&rsquo;s why I wanted to see you.&rdquo; Her voice sank to a
hoarse whisper. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the matter with
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go to a hospital?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to do that, and have all the stoodents staring at me,
and I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;d want to keep me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you complaining of?&rdquo; asked Philip coldly, with the
stereotyped phrase used in the out-patients&rsquo; room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve come out in a rash, and I can&rsquo;t get rid of
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip felt a twinge of horror in his heart. Sweat broke out on his forehead.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me look at your throat?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He took her over to the window and made such examination as he could. Suddenly
he caught sight of her eyes. There was deadly fear in them. It was horrible to
see. She was terrified. She wanted him to reassure her; she looked at him
pleadingly, not daring to ask for words of comfort but with all her nerves
astrung to receive them: he had none to offer her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re very ill indeed,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you think it is?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When he told her she grew deathly pale, and her lips even turned, yellow. she
began to cry, hopelessly, quietly at first and then with choking sobs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;But I had to
tell you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I may just as well kill myself and have done with it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He took no notice of the threat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you got any money?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Six or seven pounds.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must give up this life, you know. Don&rsquo;t you think you could
find some work to do? I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t help you much. I only get
twelve bob a week.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is there I can do now?&rdquo; she cried impatiently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Damn it all, you MUST try to get something.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He spoke to her very gravely, telling her of her own danger and the danger to
which she exposed others, and she listened sullenly. He tried to console her.
At last he brought her to a sulky acquiescence in which she promised to do all
he advised. He wrote a prescription, which he said he would leave at the
nearest chemist&rsquo;s, and he impressed upon her the necessity of taking her
medicine with the utmost regularity. Getting up to go, he held out his hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be downhearted, you&rsquo;ll soon get over your
throat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But as he went her face became suddenly distorted, and she caught hold of his
coat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t leave me,&rdquo; she cried hoarsely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so
afraid, don&rsquo;t leave me alone yet. Phil, please. There&rsquo;s no one else
I can go to, you&rsquo;re the only friend I&rsquo;ve ever had.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He felt the terror of her soul, and it was strangely like that terror he had
seen in his uncle&rsquo;s eyes when he feared that he might die. Philip looked
down. Twice that woman had come into his life and made him wretched; she had no
claim upon him; and yet, he knew not why, deep in his heart was a strange
aching; it was that which, when he received her letter, had left him no peace
till he obeyed her summons.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose I shall never really quite get over it,&rdquo; he said to
himself.
</p>

<p>
What perplexed him was that he felt a curious physical distaste, which made it
uncomfortable for him to be near her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you want me to do?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go out and dine together. I&rsquo;ll pay.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He hesitated. He felt that she was creeping back again into his life when he
thought she was gone out of it for ever. She watched him with sickening
anxiety.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I know I&rsquo;ve treated you shocking, but don&rsquo;t leave me
alone now. You&rsquo;ve had your revenge. If you leave me by myself now I
don&rsquo;t know what I shall do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but we shall have
to do it on the cheap, I haven&rsquo;t got money to throw away these
days.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She sat down and put her shoes on, then changed her skirt and put on a hat; and
they walked out together till they found a restaurant in the Tottenham Court
Road. Philip had got out of the habit of eating at those hours, and
Mildred&rsquo;s throat was so sore that she could not swallow. They had a
little cold ham and Philip drank a glass of beer. They sat opposite one
another, as they had so often sat before; he wondered if she remembered; they
had nothing to say to one another and would have sat in silence if Philip had
not forced himself to talk. In the bright light of the restaurant, with its
vulgar looking-glasses that reflected in an endless series, she looked old and
haggard. Philip was anxious to know about the child, but he had not the courage
to ask. At last she said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know baby died last summer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You might say you&rsquo;re sorry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She glanced at him and, understanding what he meant, looked away
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You were rare stuck on it at one time, weren&rsquo;t you? I always
thought it funny like how you could see so much in another man&rsquo;s
child.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When they had finished eating they called at the chemist&rsquo;s for the
medicine Philip had ordered, and going back to the shabby room he made her take
a dose. Then they sat together till it was time for Philip to go back to
Harrington Street. He was hideously bored.
</p>

<p>
Philip went to see her every day. She took the medicine he had prescribed and
followed his directions, and soon the results were so apparent that she gained
the greatest confidence in Philip&rsquo;s skill. As she grew better she grew
less despondent. She talked more freely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As soon as I can get a job I shall be all right,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had my lesson now and I mean to profit by it. No more
racketing about for yours truly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Each time he saw her, Philip asked whether she had found work. She told him not
to worry, she would find something to do as soon as she wanted it; she had
several strings to her bow; it was all the better not to do anything for a week
or two. He could not deny this, but at the end of that time he became more
insistent. She laughed at him, she was much more cheerful now, and said he was
a fussy old thing. She told him long stories of the manageresses she
interviewed, for her idea was to get work at some eating-house; what they said
and what she answered. Nothing definite was fixed, but she was sure to settle
something at the beginning of the following week: there was no use hurrying,
and it would be a mistake to take something unsuitable.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s absurd to talk like that,&rdquo; he said impatiently.
&ldquo;You must take anything you can get. I can&rsquo;t help you, and your
money won&rsquo;t last for ever.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, well, I&rsquo;ve not come to the end of it yet and chance it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked at her sharply. It was three weeks since his first visit, and she had
then less than seven pounds. Suspicion seized him. He remembered some of the
things she had said. He put two and two together. He wondered whether she had
made any attempt to find work. Perhaps she had been lying to him all the time.
It was very strange that her money should have lasted so long.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is your rent here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, the landlady&rsquo;s very nice, different from what some of them
are; she&rsquo;s quite willing to wait till it&rsquo;s convenient for me to
pay.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was silent. What he suspected was so horrible that he hesitated. It was no
use to ask her, she would deny everything; if he wanted to know he must find
out for himself. He was in the habit of leaving her every evening at eight, and
when the clock struck he got up; but instead of going back to Harrington Street
he stationed himself at the corner of Fitzroy Square so that he could see
anyone who came along William Street. It seemed to him that he waited an
interminable time, and he was on the point of going away, thinking his surmise
had been mistaken, when the door of No. 7 opened and Mildred came out. He fell
back into the darkness and watched her walk towards him. She had on the hat
with a quantity of feathers on it which he had seen in her room, and she wore a
dress he recognized, too showy for the street and unsuitable to the time of
year. He followed her slowly till she came into the Tottenham Court Road, where
she slackened her pace; at the corner of Oxford Street she stopped, looked
round, and crossed over to a music-hall. He went up to her and touched her on
the arm. He saw that she had rouged her cheeks and painted her lips.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where are you going, Mildred?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She started at the sound of his voice and reddened as she always did when she
was caught in a lie; then the flash of anger which he knew so well came into
her eyes as she instinctively sought to defend herself by abuse. But she did
not say the words which were on the tip of her tongue.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I was only going to see the show. It gives me the hump sitting every
night by myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He did not pretend to believe her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t. Good heavens, I&rsquo;ve told you fifty times how
dangerous it is. You must stop this sort of thing at once.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, hold your jaw,&rdquo; she cried roughly. &ldquo;How d&rsquo;you
suppose I&rsquo;m going to live?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He took hold of her arm and without thinking what he was doing tried to drag
her away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake come along. Let me take you home. You don&rsquo;t
know what you&rsquo;re doing. It&rsquo;s criminal.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do I care? Let them take their chance. Men haven&rsquo;t been so
good to me that I need bother my head about them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She pushed him away and walking up to the box-office put down her money. Philip
had threepence in his pocket. He could not follow. He turned away and walked
slowly down Oxford Street.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do anything more,&rdquo; he said to himself.
</p>

<p>
That was the end. He did not see her again.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>CX</h2>

<p>
Christmas that year falling on Thursday, the shop was to close for four days:
Philip wrote to his uncle asking whether it would be convenient for him to
spend the holidays at the vicarage. He received an answer from Mrs. Foster,
saying that Mr. Carey was not well enough to write himself, but wished to see
his nephew and would be glad if he came down. She met Philip at the door, and
when she shook hands with him, said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find him changed since you was here last, sir; but
you&rsquo;ll pretend you don&rsquo;t notice anything, won&rsquo;t you, sir?
He&rsquo;s that nervous about himself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip nodded, and she led him into the dining-room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Mr. Philip, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Vicar of Blackstable was a dying man. There was no mistaking that when you
looked at the hollow cheeks and the shrunken body. He sat huddled in the
arm-chair, with his head strangely thrown back, and a shawl over his shoulders.
He could not walk now without the help of sticks, and his hands trembled so
that he could only feed himself with difficulty.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t last long now,&rdquo; thought Philip, as he looked at
him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How d&rsquo;you think I&rsquo;m looking?&rdquo; asked the Vicar.
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you think I&rsquo;ve changed since you were here last?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you look stronger than you did last summer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was the heat. That always upsets me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Carey&rsquo;s history of the last few months consisted in the number of
weeks he had spent in his bed-room and the number of weeks he had spent
downstairs. He had a hand-bell by his side and while he talked he rang it for
Mrs. Foster, who sat in the next room ready to attend to his wants, to ask on
what day of the month he had first left his room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On the seventh of November, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Carey looked at Philip to see how he took the information.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I eat well still, don&rsquo;t I, Mrs. Foster?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir, you&rsquo;ve got a wonderful appetite.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem to put on flesh though.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nothing interested him now but his health. He was set upon one thing
indomitably and that was living, just living, notwithstanding the monotony of
his life and the constant pain which allowed him to sleep only when he was
under the influence of morphia.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s terrible, the amount of money I have to spend on
doctor&rsquo;s bills.&rdquo; He tinkled his bell again. &ldquo;Mrs. Foster,
show Master Philip the chemist&rsquo;s bill.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Patiently she took it off the chimney-piece and handed it to Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only one month. I was wondering if as you&rsquo;re
doctoring yourself you couldn&rsquo;t get me the drugs cheaper. I thought of
getting them down from the stores, but then there&rsquo;s the postage.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Though apparently taking so little interest in him that he did not trouble to
inquire what Phil was doing, he seemed glad to have him there. He asked how
long he could stay, and when Philip told him he must leave on Tuesday morning,
expressed a wish that the visit might have been longer. He told him minutely
all his symptoms and repeated what the doctor had said of him. He broke off to
ring his bell, and when Mrs. Foster came in, said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I wasn&rsquo;t sure if you were there. I only rang to see if you
were.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When she had gone he explained to Philip that it made him uneasy if he was not
certain that Mrs. Foster was within earshot; she knew exactly what to do with
him if anything happened. Philip, seeing that she was tired and that her eyes
were heavy from want of sleep, suggested that he was working her too hard.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, nonsense,&rdquo; said the Vicar, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s as strong as a
horse.&rdquo; And when next she came in to give him his medicine he said to
her:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Master Philip says you&rsquo;ve got too much to do, Mrs. Foster. You
like looking after me, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind, sir. I want to do everything I can.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Presently the medicine took effect and Mr. Carey fell asleep. Philip went into
the kitchen and asked Mrs. Foster whether she could stand the work. He saw that
for some months she had had little peace.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, sir, what can I do?&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;The poor old
gentleman&rsquo;s so dependent on me, and, although he is troublesome
sometimes, you can&rsquo;t help liking him, can you? I&rsquo;ve been here so
many years now, I don&rsquo;t know what I shall do when he comes to go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip saw that she was really fond of the old man. She washed and dressed him,
gave him his food, and was up half a dozen times in the night; for she slept in
the next room to his and whenever he awoke he tinkled his little bell till she
came in. He might die at any moment, but he might live for months. It was
wonderful that she should look after a stranger with such patient tenderness,
and it was tragic and pitiful that she should be alone in the world to care for
him.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to Philip that the religion which his uncle had preached all his life
was now of no more than formal importance to him: every Sunday the curate came
and administered to him Holy Communion, and he often read his Bible; but it was
clear that he looked upon death with horror. He believed that it was the
gateway to life everlasting, but he did not want to enter upon that life. In
constant pain, chained to his chair and having given up the hope of ever
getting out into the open again, like a child in the hands of a woman to whom
he paid wages, he clung to the world he knew.
</p>

<p>
In Philip&rsquo;s head was a question he could not ask, because he was aware
that his uncle would never give any but a conventional answer: he wondered
whether at the very end, now that the machine was painfully wearing itself out,
the clergyman still believed in immortality; perhaps at the bottom of his soul,
not allowed to shape itself into words in case it became urgent, was the
conviction that there was no God and after this life nothing.
</p>

<p>
On the evening of Boxing Day Philip sat in the dining-room with his uncle. He
had to start very early next morning in order to get to the shop by nine, and
he was to say good-night to Mr. Carey then. The Vicar of Blackstable was dozing
and Philip, lying on the sofa by the window, let his book fall on his knees and
looked idly round the room. He asked himself how much the furniture would
fetch. He had walked round the house and looked at the things he had known from
his childhood; there were a few pieces of china which might go for a decent
price and Philip wondered if it would be worth while to take them up to London;
but the furniture was of the Victorian order, of mahogany, solid and ugly; it
would go for nothing at an auction. There were three or four thousand books,
but everyone knew how badly they sold, and it was not probable that they would
fetch more than a hundred pounds. Philip did not know how much his uncle would
leave, and he reckoned out for the hundredth time what was the least sum upon
which he could finish the curriculum at the hospital, take his degree, and live
during the time he wished to spend on hospital appointments. He looked at the
old man, sleeping restlessly: there was no humanity left in that shrivelled
face; it was the face of some queer animal. Philip thought how easy it would be
to finish that useless life. He had thought it each evening when Mrs. Foster
prepared for his uncle the medicine which was to give him an easy night. There
were two bottles: one contained a drug which he took regularly, and the other
an opiate if the pain grew unendurable. This was poured out for him and left by
his bed-side. He generally took it at three or four in the morning. It would be
a simple thing to double the dose; he would die in the night, and no one would
suspect anything; for that was how Doctor Wigram expected him to die. The end
would be painless. Philip clenched his hands as he thought of the money he
wanted so badly. A few more months of that wretched life could matter nothing
to the old man, but the few more months meant everything to him: he was getting
to the end of his endurance, and when he thought of going back to work in the
morning he shuddered with horror. His heart beat quickly at the thought which
obsessed him, and though he made an effort to put it out of his mind he could
not. It would be so easy, so desperately easy. He had no feeling for the old
man, he had never liked him; he had been selfish all his life, selfish to his
wife who adored him, indifferent to the boy who had been put in his charge; he
was not a cruel man, but a stupid, hard man, eaten up with a small sensuality.
It would be easy, desperately easy. Philip did not dare. He was afraid of
remorse; it would be no good having the money if he regretted all his life what
he had done. Though he had told himself so often that regret was futile, there
were certain things that came back to him occasionally and worried him. He
wished they were not on his conscience.
</p>

<p>
His uncle opened his eyes; Philip was glad, for he looked a little more human
then. He was frankly horrified at the idea that had come to him, it was murder
that he was meditating; and he wondered if other people had such thoughts or
whether he was abnormal and depraved. He supposed he could not have done it
when it came to the point, but there the thought was, constantly recurring: if
he held his hand it was from fear. His uncle spoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not looking forward to my death, Philip?&rdquo; Philip felt
his heart beat against his chest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good heavens, no.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good boy. I shouldn&rsquo;t like you to do that.
You&rsquo;ll get a little bit of money when I pass away, but you mustn&rsquo;t
look forward to it. It wouldn&rsquo;t profit you if you did.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He spoke in a low voice, and there was a curious anxiety in his tone. It sent a
pang into Philip&rsquo;s heart. He wondered what strange insight might have led
the old man to surmise what strange desires were in Philip&rsquo;s mind.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll live for another twenty years,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, well, I can&rsquo;t expect to do that, but if I take care of myself
I don&rsquo;t see why I shouldn&rsquo;t last another three or four.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was silent for a while, and Philip found nothing to say. Then, as if he had
been thinking it all over, the old man spoke again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Everyone has the right to live as long as he can.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip wanted to distract his mind.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By the way, I suppose you never hear from Miss Wilkinson now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I had a letter some time this year. She&rsquo;s married, you
know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, she married a widower. I believe they&rsquo;re quite
comfortable.&rdquo;
</p>

<h2>CXI</h2>

<p>
Next day Philip began work again, but the end which he expected within a few
weeks did not come. The weeks passed into months. The winter wore away, and in
the parks the trees burst into bud and into leaf. A terrible lassitude settled
upon Philip. Time was passing, though it went with such heavy feet, and he
thought that his youth was going and soon he would have lost it and nothing
would have been accomplished. His work seemed more aimless now that there was
the certainty of his leaving it. He became skilful in the designing of
costumes, and though he had no inventive faculty acquired quickness in the
adaptation of French fashions to the English market. Sometimes he was not
displeased with his drawings, but they always bungled them in the execution. He
was amused to notice that he suffered from a lively irritation when his ideas
were not adequately carried out. He had to walk warily. Whenever he suggested
something original Mr. Sampson turned it down: their customers did not want
anything outre, it was a very respectable class of business, and when you had a
connection of that sort it wasn&rsquo;t worth while taking liberties with it.
Once or twice he spoke sharply to Philip; he thought the young man was getting
a bit above himself, because Philip&rsquo;s ideas did not always coincide with
his own.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You jolly well take care, my fine young fellow, or one of these days
you&rsquo;ll find yourself in the street.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip longed to give him a punch on the nose, but he restrained himself. After
all it could not possibly last much longer, and then he would be done with all
these people for ever. Sometimes in comic desperation he cried out that his
uncle must be made of iron. What a constitution! The ills he suffered from
would have killed any decent person twelve months before. When at last the news
came that the Vicar was dying Philip, who had been thinking of other things,
was taken by surprise. It was in July, and in another fortnight he was to have
gone for his holiday. He received a letter from Mrs. Foster to say the doctor
did not give Mr. Carey many days to live, and if Philip wished to see him again
he must come at once. Philip went to the buyer and told him he wanted to leave.
Mr. Sampson was a decent fellow, and when he knew the circumstances made no
difficulties. Philip said good-bye to the people in his department; the reason
of his leaving had spread among them in an exaggerated form, and they thought
he had come into a fortune. Mrs. Hodges had tears in her eyes when she shook
hands with him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose we shan&rsquo;t often see you again,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to get away from Lynn&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
It was strange, but he was actually sorry to leave these people whom he thought
he had loathed, and when he drove away from the house in Harrington Street it
was with no exultation. He had so anticipated the emotions he would experience
on this occasion that now he felt nothing: he was as unconcerned as though he
were going for a few days&rsquo; holiday.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a rotten nature,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;I look
forward to things awfully, and then when they come I&rsquo;m always
disappointed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He reached Blackstable early in the afternoon. Mrs. Foster met him at the door,
and her face told him that his uncle was not yet dead.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a little better today,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got
a wonderful constitution.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She led him into the bed-room where Mr. Carey lay on his back. He gave Philip a
slight smile, in which was a trace of satisfied cunning at having circumvented
his enemy once more.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought it was all up with me yesterday,&rdquo; he said, in an
exhausted voice. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d all given me up, hadn&rsquo;t you, Mrs.
Foster?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a wonderful constitution, there&rsquo;s no denying
that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s life in the old dog yet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Foster said that the Vicar must not talk, it would tire him; she treated
him like a child, with kindly despotism; and there was something childish in
the old man&rsquo;s satisfaction at having cheated all their expectations. It
struck him at once that Philip had been sent for, and he was amused that he had
been brought on a fool&rsquo;s errand. If he could only avoid another of his
heart attacks he would get well enough in a week or two; and he had had the
attacks several times before; he always felt as if he were going to die, but he
never did. They all talked of his constitution, but they none of them knew how
strong it was.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you going to stay a day or two?&rdquo; He asked Philip, pretending
to believe he had come down for a holiday.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was thinking of it,&rdquo; Philip answered cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A breath of sea-air will do you good.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Presently Dr. Wigram came, and after he had seen the Vicar talked with Philip.
He adopted an appropriate manner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it is the end this time, Philip,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a great loss to all of us. I&rsquo;ve known him for
five-and-thirty years.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He seems well enough now,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m keeping him alive on drugs, but it can&rsquo;t last. It was
dreadful these last two days, I thought he was dead half a dozen times.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The doctor was silent for a minute or two, but at the gate he said suddenly to
Philip:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has Mrs. Foster said anything to you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re very superstitious, these people: she&rsquo;s got hold of
an idea that he&rsquo;s got something on his mind, and he can&rsquo;t die till
he gets rid of it; and he can&rsquo;t bring himself to confess it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip did not answer, and the doctor went on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s nonsense. He&rsquo;s led a very good life,
he&rsquo;s done his duty, he&rsquo;s been a good parish priest, and I&rsquo;m
sure we shall all miss him; he can&rsquo;t have anything to reproach himself
with. I very much doubt whether the next vicar will suit us half so
well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
For several days Mr. Carey continued without change. His appetite which had
been excellent left him, and he could eat little. Dr. Wigram did not hesitate
now to still the pain of the neuritis which tormented him; and that, with the
constant shaking of his palsied limbs, was gradually exhausting him. His mind
remained clear. Philip and Mrs. Foster nursed him between them. She was so
tired by the many months during which she had been attentive to all his wants
that Philip insisted on sitting up with the patient so that she might have her
night&rsquo;s rest. He passed the long hours in an arm-chair so that he should
not sleep soundly, and read by the light of shaded candles The Thousand and One
Nights. He had not read them since he was a little boy, and they brought back
his childhood to him. Sometimes he sat and listened to the silence of the
night. When the effects of the opiate wore off Mr. Carey grew restless and kept
him constantly busy.
</p>

<p>
At last, early one morning, when the birds were chattering noisily in the
trees, he heard his name called. He went up to the bed. Mr. Carey was lying on
his back, with his eyes looking at the ceiling; he did not turn them on Philip.
Philip saw that sweat was on his forehead, and he took a towel and wiped it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is that you, Philip?&rdquo; the old man asked.
</p>

<p>
Philip was startled because the voice was suddenly changed. It was hoarse and
low. So would a man speak if he was cold with fear.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, d&rsquo;you want anything?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a pause, and still the unseeing eyes stared at the ceiling. Then a
twitch passed over the face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m going to die,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, what nonsense!&rdquo; cried Philip. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to
die for years.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Two tears were wrung from the old man&rsquo;s eyes. They moved Philip horribly.
His uncle had never betrayed any particular emotion in the affairs of life; and
it was dreadful to see them now, for they signified a terror that was
unspeakable.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Send for Mr. Simmonds,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want to take the
Communion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Simmonds was the curate.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Soon, or else it&rsquo;ll be too late.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip went to awake Mrs. Foster, but it was later than he thought and she was
up already. He told her to send the gardener with a message, and he went back
to his uncle&rsquo;s room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you sent for Mr. Simmonds?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a silence. Philip sat by the bed-side, and occasionally wiped the
sweating forehead.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me hold your hand, Philip,&rdquo; the old man said at last.
</p>

<p>
Philip gave him his hand and he clung to it as to life, for comfort in his
extremity. Perhaps he had never really loved anyone in all his days, but now he
turned instinctively to a human being. His hand was wet and cold. It grasped
Philip&rsquo;s with feeble, despairing energy. The old man was fighting with
the fear of death. And Philip thought that all must go through that. Oh, how
monstrous it was, and they could believe in a God that allowed his creatures to
suffer such a cruel torture! He had never cared for his uncle, and for two
years he had longed every day for his death; but now he could not overcome the
compassion that filled his heart. What a price it was to pay for being other
than the beasts!
</p>

<p>
They remained in silence broken only once by a low inquiry from Mr. Carey.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he come yet?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At last the housekeeper came in softly to say that Mr. Simmonds was there. He
carried a bag in which were his surplice and his hood. Mrs. Foster brought the
communion plate. Mr. Simmonds shook hands silently with Philip, and then with
professional gravity went to the sick man&rsquo;s side. Philip and the maid
went out of the room.
</p>

<p>
Philip walked round the garden all fresh and dewy in the morning. The birds
were singing gaily. The sky was blue, but the air, salt-laden, was sweet and
cool. The roses were in full bloom. The green of the trees, the green of the
lawns, was eager and brilliant. Philip walked, and as he walked he thought of
the mystery which was proceeding in that bedroom. It gave him a peculiar
emotion. Presently Mrs. Foster came out to him and said that his uncle wished
to see him. The curate was putting his things back into the black bag. The sick
man turned his head a little and greeted him with a smile. Philip was
astonished, for there was a change in him, an extraordinary change; his eyes
had no longer the terror-stricken look, and the pinching of his face had gone:
he looked happy and serene.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite prepared now,&rdquo; he said, and his voice had a
different tone in it. &ldquo;When the Lord sees fit to call me I am ready to
give my soul into his hands.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip did not speak. He could see that his uncle was sincere. It was almost a
miracle. He had taken the body and blood of his Savior, and they had given him
strength so that he no longer feared the inevitable passage into the night. He
knew he was going to die: he was resigned. He only said one thing more:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall rejoin my dear wife.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It startled Philip. He remembered with what a callous selfishness his uncle had
treated her, how obtuse he had been to her humble, devoted love. The curate,
deeply moved, went away and Mrs. Foster, weeping, accompanied him to the door.
Mr. Carey, exhausted by his effort, fell into a light doze, and Philip sat down
by the bed and waited for the end. The morning wore on, and the old man&rsquo;s
breathing grew stertorous. The doctor came and said he was dying. He was
unconscious and he pecked feebly at the sheets; he was restless and he cried
out. Dr. Wigram gave him a hypodermic injection.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t do any good now, he may die at any moment.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The doctor looked at his watch and then at the patient. Philip saw that it was
one o&rsquo;clock. Dr. Wigram was thinking of his dinner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use your waiting,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing I can do,&rdquo; said the doctor.
</p>

<p>
When he was gone Mrs. Foster asked Philip if he would go to the carpenter, who
was also the undertaker, and tell him to send up a woman to lay out the body.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You want a little fresh air,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll do you
good.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The undertaker lived half a mile away. When Philip gave him his message, he
said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When did the poor old gentleman die?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip hesitated. It occurred to him that it would seem brutal to fetch a woman
to wash the body while his uncle still lived, and he wondered why Mrs. Foster
had asked him to come. They would think he was in a great hurry to kill the old
man off. He thought the undertaker looked at him oddly. He repeated the
question. It irritated Philip. It was no business of his.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When did the Vicar pass away?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip&rsquo;s first impulse was to say that it had just happened, but then it
would seem inexplicable if the sick man lingered for several hours. He reddened
and answered awkwardly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, he isn&rsquo;t exactly dead yet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The undertaker looked at him in perplexity, and he hurried to explain.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mrs. Foster is all alone and she wants a woman there. You understood,
don&rsquo;t you? He may be dead by now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The undertaker nodded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes, I see. I&rsquo;ll send someone up at once.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When Philip got back to the vicarage he went up to the bed-room. Mrs. Foster
rose from her chair by the bed-side.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just as he was when you left,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
She went down to get herself something to eat, and Philip watched curiously the
process of death. There was nothing human now in the unconscious being that
struggled feebly. Sometimes a muttered ejaculation issued from the loose mouth.
The sun beat down hotly from a cloudless sky, but the trees in the garden were
pleasant and cool. It was a lovely day. A bluebottle buzzed against the
windowpane. Suddenly there was a loud rattle, it made Philip start, it was
horribly frightening; a movement passed through the limbs and the old man was
dead. The machine had run down. The bluebottle buzzed, buzzed noisily against
the windowpane.
</p>

<h2>CXII</h2>

<p>
Josiah Graves in his masterful way made arrangements, becoming but economical,
for the funeral; and when it was over came back to the vicarage with Philip.
The will was in his charge, and with a due sense of the fitness of things he
read it to Philip over an early cup of tea. It was written on half a sheet of
paper and left everything Mr. Carey had to his nephew. There was the furniture,
about eighty pounds at the bank, twenty shares in the A. B. C. company, a few
in Allsop&rsquo;s brewery, some in the Oxford music-hall, and a few more in a
London restaurant. They had been bought under Mr. Graves&rsquo; direction, and
he told Philip with satisfaction:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see, people must eat, they will drink, and they want amusement.
You&rsquo;re always safe if you put your money in what the public thinks
necessities.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His words showed a nice discrimination between the grossness of the vulgar,
which he deplored but accepted, and the finer taste of the elect. Altogether in
investments there was about five hundred pounds; and to that must be added the
balance at the bank and what the furniture would fetch. It was riches to
Philip. He was not happy but infinitely relieved.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Graves left him, after they had discussed the auction which must be held as
soon as possible, and Philip sat himself down to go through the papers of the
deceased. The Rev. William Carey had prided himself on never destroying
anything, and there were piles of correspondence dating back for fifty years
and bundles upon bundles of neatly docketed bills. He had kept not only letters
addressed to him, but letters which himself had written. There was a yellow
packet of letters which he had written to his father in the forties, when as an
Oxford undergraduate he had gone to Germany for the long vacation. Philip read
them idly. It was a different William Carey from the William Carey he had
known, and yet there were traces in the boy which might to an acute observer
have suggested the man. The letters were formal and a little stilted. He showed
himself strenuous to see all that was noteworthy, and he described with a fine
enthusiasm the castles of the Rhine. The falls of Schaffhausen made him
&lsquo;offer reverent thanks to the all-powerful Creator of the universe, whose
works were wondrous and beautiful,&rsquo; and he could not help thinking that
they who lived in sight of &lsquo;this handiwork of their blessed Maker must be
moved by the contemplation to lead pure and holy lives.&rsquo; Among some bills
Philip found a miniature which had been painted of William Carey soon after he
was ordained. It represented a thin young curate, with long hair that fell over
his head in natural curls, with dark eyes, large and dreamy, and a pale ascetic
face. Philip remembered the chuckle with which his uncle used to tell of the
dozens of slippers which were worked for him by adoring ladies.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the afternoon and all the evening Philip toiled through the
innumerable correspondence. He glanced at the address and at the signature,
then tore the letter in two and threw it into the washing-basket by his side.
Suddenly he came upon one signed Helen. He did not know the writing. It was
thin, angular, and old-fashioned. It began: my dear William, and ended: your
affectionate sister. Then it struck him that it was from his own mother. He had
never seen a letter of hers before, and her handwriting was strange to him. It
was about himself.
</p>

<p>
My dear William,
</p>

<p>
Stephen wrote to you to thank you for your congratulations on the birth of our
son and your kind wishes to myself. Thank God we are both well and I am deeply
thankful for the great mercy which has been shown me. Now that I can hold a pen
I want to tell you and dear Louisa myself how truly grateful I am to you both
for all your kindness to me now and always since my marriage. I am going to ask
you to do me a great favour. Both Stephen and I wish you to be the boy&rsquo;s
godfather, and we hope that you will consent. I know I am not asking a small
thing, for I am sure you will take the responsibilities of the position very
seriously, but I am especially anxious that you should undertake this office
because you are a clergyman as well as the boy&rsquo;s uncle. I am very anxious
for the boy&rsquo;s welfare and I pray God night and day that he may grow into
a good, honest, and Christian man. With you to guide him I hope that he will
become a soldier in Christ&rsquo;s Faith and be all the days of his life
God-fearing, humble, and pious.
</p>

<p>
                                      Your affectionate sister,<br/>
                                                               Helen.
</p>

<p>
Philip pushed the letter away and, leaning forward, rested his face on his
hands. It deeply touched and at the same time surprised him. He was astonished
at its religious tone, which seemed to him neither mawkish nor sentimental. He
knew nothing of his mother, dead now for nearly twenty years, but that she was
beautiful, and it was strange to learn that she was simple and pious. He had
never thought of that side of her. He read again what she said about him, what
she expected and thought about him; he had turned out very differently; he
looked at himself for a moment; perhaps it was better that she was dead. Then a
sudden impulse caused him to tear up the letter; its tenderness and simplicity
made it seem peculiarly private; he had a queer feeling that there was
something indecent in his reading what exposed his mother&rsquo;s gentle soul.
He went on with the Vicar&rsquo;s dreary correspondence.
</p>

<p>
A few days later he went up to London, and for the first time for two years
entered by day the hall of St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital. He went to see the
secretary of the Medical School; he was surprised to see him and asked Philip
curiously what he had been doing. Philip&rsquo;s experiences had given him a
certain confidence in himself and a different outlook upon many things: such a
question would have embarrassed him before; but now he answered coolly, with a
deliberate vagueness which prevented further inquiry, that private affairs had
obliged him to make a break in the curriculum; he was now anxious to qualify as
soon as possible. The first examination he could take was in midwifery and the
diseases of women, and he put his name down to be a clerk in the ward devoted
to feminine ailments; since it was holiday time there happened to be no
difficulty in getting a post as obstetric clerk; he arranged to undertake that
duty during the last week of August and the first two of September. After this
interview Philip walked through the Medical School, more or less deserted, for
the examinations at the end of the summer session were all over; and he
wandered along the terrace by the river-side. His heart was full. He thought
that now he could begin a new life, and he would put behind him all the errors,
follies, and miseries of the past. The flowing river suggested that everything
passed, was passing always, and nothing mattered; the future was before him
rich with possibilities.
</p>

<p>
He went back to Blackstable and busied himself with the settling up of his
uncle&rsquo;s estate. The auction was fixed for the middle of August, when the
presence of visitors for the summer holidays would make it possible to get
better prices. Catalogues were made out and sent to the various dealers in
second-hand books at Tercanbury, Maidstone, and Ashford.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon Philip took it into his head to go over to Tercanbury and see his
old school. He had not been there since the day when, with relief in his heart,
he had left it with the feeling that thenceforward he was his own master. It
was strange to wander through the narrow streets of Tercanbury which he had
known so well for so many years. He looked at the old shops, still there, still
selling the same things; the booksellers with school-books, pious works, and
the latest novels in one window and photographs of the Cathedral and of the
city in the other; the games shop, with its cricket bats, fishing tackle,
tennis rackets, and footballs; the tailor from whom he had got clothes all
through his boyhood; and the fishmonger where his uncle whenever he came to
Tercanbury bought fish. He wandered along the sordid street in which, behind a
high wall, lay the red brick house which was the preparatory school. Further on
was the gateway that led into King&rsquo;s School, and he stood in the
quadrangle round which were the various buildings. It was just four and the
boys were hurrying out of school. He saw the masters in their gowns and
mortar-boards, and they were strange to him. It was more than ten years since
he had left and many changes had taken place. He saw the headmaster; he walked
slowly down from the schoolhouse to his own, talking to a big boy who Philip
supposed was in the sixth; he was little changed, tall, cadaverous, romantic as
Philip remembered him, with the same wild eyes; but the black beard was
streaked with gray now and the dark, sallow face was more deeply lined. Philip
had an impulse to go up and speak to him, but he was afraid he would have
forgotten him, and he hated the thought of explaining who he was.
</p>

<p>
Boys lingered talking to one another, and presently some who had hurried to
change came out to play fives; others straggled out in twos and threes and went
out of the gateway, Philip knew they were going up to the cricket ground;
others again went into the precincts to bat at the nets. Philip stood among
them a stranger; one or two gave him an indifferent glance; but visitors,
attracted by the Norman staircase, were not rare and excited little attention.
Philip looked at them curiously. He thought with melancholy of the distance
that separated him from them, and he thought bitterly how much he had wanted to
do and how little done. It seemed to him that all those years, vanished beyond
recall, had been utterly wasted. The boys, fresh and buoyant, were doing the
same things that he had done, it seemed that not a day had passed since he left
the school, and yet in that place where at least by name he had known everybody
now he knew not a soul. In a few years these too, others taking their place,
would stand alien as he stood; but the reflection brought him no solace; it
merely impressed upon him the futility of human existence. Each generation
repeated the trivial round. He wondered what had become of the boys who were
his companions: they were nearly thirty now; some would be dead, but others
were married and had children; they were soldiers and parsons, doctors,
lawyers; they were staid men who were beginning to put youth behind them. Had
any of them made such a hash of life as he? He thought of the boy he had been
devoted to; it was funny, he could not recall his name; he remembered exactly
what he looked like, he had been his greatest friend; but his name would not
come back to him. He looked back with amusement on the jealous emotions he had
suffered on his account. It was irritating not to recollect his name. He longed
to be a boy again, like those he saw sauntering through the quadrangle, so
that, avoiding his mistakes, he might start fresh and make something more out
of life. He felt an intolerable loneliness. He almost regretted the penury
which he had suffered during the last two years, since the desperate struggle
merely to keep body and soul together had deadened the pain of living. In the
sweat of thy brow shalt thou earn thy daily bread: it was not a curse upon
mankind, but the balm which reconciled it to existence.
</p>

<p>
But Philip was impatient with himself; he called to mind his idea of the
pattern of life: the unhappiness he had suffered was no more than part of a
decoration which was elaborate and beautiful; he told himself strenuously that
he must accept with gaiety everything, dreariness and excitement, pleasure and
pain, because it added to the richness of the design. He sought for beauty
consciously, and he remembered how even as a boy he had taken pleasure in the
Gothic cathedral as one saw it from the precincts; he went there and looked at
the massive pile, gray under the cloudy sky, with the central tower that rose
like the praise of men to their God; but the boys were batting at the nets, and
they were lissom and strong and active; he could not help hearing their shouts
and laughter. The cry of youth was insistent, and he saw the beautiful thing
before him only with his eyes.

<h2>CXIII</h2>

<p>
At the beginning of the last week in August Philip entered upon his duties in
the &lsquo;district.&rsquo; They were arduous, for he had to attend on an
average three confinements a day. The patient had obtained a &lsquo;card&rsquo;
from the hospital some time before; and when her time came it was taken to the
porter by a messenger, generally a little girl, who was then sent across the
road to the house in which Philip lodged. At night the porter, who had a
latch-key, himself came over and awoke Philip. It was mysterious then to get up
in the darkness and walk through the deserted streets of the South Side. At
those hours it was generally the husband who brought the card. If there had
been a number of babies before he took it for the most part with surly
indifference, but if newly married he was nervous and then sometimes strove to
allay his anxiety by getting drunk. Often there was a mile or more to walk,
during which Philip and the messenger discussed the conditions of labour and
the cost of living; Philip learnt about the various trades which were practised
on that side of the river. He inspired confidence in the people among whom he
was thrown, and during the long hours that he waited in a stuffy room, the
woman in labour lying on a large bed that took up half of it, her mother and
the midwife talked to him as naturally as they talked to one another. The
circumstances in which he had lived during the last two years had taught him
several things about the life of the very poor, which it amused them to find he
knew; and they were impressed because he was not deceived by their little
subterfuges. He was kind, and he had gentle hands, and he did not lose his
temper. They were pleased because he was not above drinking a cup of tea with
them, and when the dawn came and they were still waiting they offered him a
slice of bread and dripping; he was not squeamish and could eat most things now
with a good appetite. Some of the houses he went to, in filthy courts off a
dingy street, huddled against one another without light or air, were merely
squalid; but others, unexpectedly, though dilapidated, with worm-eaten floors
and leaking roofs, had the grand air: you found in them oak balusters
exquisitely carved, and the walls had still their panelling. These were thickly
inhabited. One family lived in each room, and in the daytime there was the
incessant noise of children playing in the court. The old walls were the
breeding-place of vermin; the air was so foul that often, feeling sick, Philip
had to light his pipe. The people who dwelt here lived from hand to mouth.
Babies were unwelcome, the man received them with surly anger, the mother with
despair; it was one more mouth to feed, and there was little enough wherewith
to feed those already there. Philip often discerned the wish that the child
might be born dead or might die quickly. He delivered one woman of twins (a
source of humour to the facetious) and when she was told she burst into a long,
shrill wail of misery. Her mother said outright:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how they&rsquo;re going to feed &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Maybe the Lord&rsquo;ll see fit to take &rsquo;em to
&rsquo;imself,&rdquo; said the midwife.
</p>

<p>
Philip caught sight of the husband&rsquo;s face as he looked at the tiny pair
lying side by side, and there was a ferocious sullenness in it which startled
him. He felt in the family assembled there a hideous resentment against those
poor atoms who had come into the world unwished for; and he had a suspicion
that if he did not speak firmly an &lsquo;accident&rsquo; would occur.
Accidents occurred often; mothers &lsquo;overlay&rsquo; their babies, and
perhaps errors of diet were not always the result of carelessness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall come every day,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I warn you that if
anything happens to them there&rsquo;ll have to be an inquest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The father made no reply, but he gave Philip a scowl. There was murder in his
soul.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bless their little &rsquo;earts,&rdquo; said the grandmother,
&ldquo;what should &rsquo;appen to them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The great difficulty was to keep the mothers in bed for ten days, which was the
minimum upon which the hospital practice insisted. It was awkward to look after
the family, no one would see to the children without payment, and the husband
tumbled because his tea was not right when he came home tired from his work and
hungry. Philip had heard that the poor helped one another, but woman after
woman complained to him that she could not get anyone in to clean up and see to
the children&rsquo;s dinner without paying for the service, and she could not
afford to pay. By listening to the women as they talked and by chance remarks
from which he could deduce much that was left unsaid, Philip learned how little
there was in common between the poor and the classes above them. They did not
envy their betters, for the life was too different, and they had an ideal of
ease which made the existence of the middle-classes seem formal and stiff;
moreover, they had a certain contempt for them because they were soft and did
not work with their hands. The proud merely wished to be left alone, but the
majority looked upon the well-to-do as people to be exploited; they knew what
to say in order to get such advantages as the charitable put at their disposal,
and they accepted benefits as a right which came to them from the folly of
their superiors and their own astuteness. They bore the curate with
contemptuous indifference, but the district visitor excited their bitter
hatred. She came in and opened your windows without so much as a by your leave
or with your leave, &rsquo;and me with my bronchitis, enough to give me my
death of cold;&rsquo; she poked her nose into corners, and if she didn&rsquo;t
say the place was dirty you saw what she thought right enough, &lsquo;an&rsquo;
it&rsquo;s all very well for them as &lsquo;as servants, but I&rsquo;d like to
see what she&rsquo;d make of &rsquo;er room if she &rsquo;ad four children, and
&rsquo;ad to do the cookin&rsquo;, and mend their clothes, and wash
them.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip discovered that the greatest tragedy of life to these people was not
separation or death, that was natural and the grief of it could be assuaged
with tears, but loss of work. He saw a man come home one afternoon, three days
after his wife&rsquo;s confinement, and tell her he had been dismissed; he was
a builder and at that time work was slack; he stated the fact, and sat down to
his tea.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Jim,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
The man ate stolidly some mess which had been stewing in a sauce-pan against
his coming; he stared at his plate; his wife looked at him two or three times,
with little startled glances, and then quite silently began to cry. The builder
was an uncouth little fellow with a rough, weather-beaten face and a long white
scar on his forehead; he had large, stubbly hands. Presently he pushed aside
his plate as if he must give up the effort to force himself to eat, and turned
a fixed gaze out of the window. The room was at the top of the house, at the
back, and one saw nothing but sullen clouds. The silence seemed heavy with
despair. Philip felt that there was nothing to be said, he could only go; and
as he walked away wearily, for he had been up most of the night, his heart was
filled with rage against the cruelty of the world. He knew the hopelessness of
the search for work and the desolation which is harder to bear than hunger. He
was thankful not to have to believe in God, for then such a condition of things
would be intolerable; one could reconcile oneself to existence only because it
was meaningless.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to Philip that the people who spent their time in helping the poorer
classes erred because they sought to remedy things which would harass them if
themselves had to endure them without thinking that they did not in the least
disturb those who were used to them. The poor did not want large airy rooms;
they suffered from cold, for their food was not nourishing and their
circulation bad; space gave them a feeling of chilliness, and they wanted to
burn as little coal as need be; there was no hardship for several to sleep in
one room, they preferred it; they were never alone for a moment, from the time
they were born to the time they died, and loneliness oppressed them; they
enjoyed the promiscuity in which they dwelt, and the constant noise of their
surroundings pressed upon their ears unnoticed. They did not feel the need of
taking a bath constantly, and Philip often heard them speak with indignation of
the necessity to do so with which they were faced on entering the hospital: it
was both an affront and a discomfort. They wanted chiefly to be left alone;
then if the man was in regular work life went easily and was not without its
pleasures: there was plenty of time for gossip, after the day&rsquo;s work a
glass of beer was very good to drink, the streets were a constant source of
entertainment, if you wanted to read there was Reynolds&rsquo; or The News of
the World; &lsquo;but there, you couldn&rsquo;t make out &rsquo;ow the time did
fly, the truth was and that&rsquo;s a fact, you was a rare one for reading when
you was a girl, but what with one thing and another you didn&rsquo;t get no
time now not even to read the paper.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
The usual practice was to pay three visits after a confinement, and one Sunday
Philip went to see a patient at the dinner hour. She was up for the first time.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stay in bed no longer, I really couldn&rsquo;t.
I&rsquo;m not one for idling, and it gives me the fidgets to be there and do
nothing all day long, so I said to &rsquo;Erb, I&rsquo;m just going to get up
and cook your dinner for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&rsquo;Erb was sitting at table with his knife and fork already in his hands.
He was a young man, with an open face and blue eyes. He was earning good money,
and as things went the couple were in easy circumstances. They had only been
married a few months, and were both delighted with the rosy boy who lay in the
cradle at the foot of the bed. There was a savoury smell of beefsteak in the
room and Philip&rsquo;s eyes turned to the range.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was just going to dish up this minute,&rdquo; said the woman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fire away,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just have a look at the
son and heir and then I&rsquo;ll take myself off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Husband and wife laughed at Philip&rsquo;s expression, and &rsquo;Erb getting
up went over with Philip to the cradle. He looked at his baby proudly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There doesn&rsquo;t seem much wrong with him, does there?&rdquo; said
Philip.
</p>

<p>
He took up his hat, and by this time &rsquo;Erb&rsquo;s wife had dished up the
beefsteak and put on the table a plate of green peas.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to have a nice dinner,&rdquo; smiled Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s only in of a Sunday and I like to &rsquo;ave something
special for him, so as he shall miss his &rsquo;ome when he&rsquo;s out at
work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;d be above sittin&rsquo; down and &rsquo;avin&rsquo;
a bit of dinner with us?&rdquo; said &rsquo;Erb.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, &rsquo;Erb,&rdquo; said his wife, in a shocked tone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not if you ask me,&rdquo; answered Philip, with his attractive smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what I call friendly, I knew &rsquo;e wouldn&rsquo;t
take offence, Polly. Just get another plate, my girl.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Polly was flustered, and she thought &rsquo;Erb a regular caution, you never
knew what ideas &rsquo;e&rsquo;d get in &rsquo;is &rsquo;ead next; but she got
a plate and wiped it quickly with her apron, then took a new knife and fork
from the chest of drawers, where her best cutlery rested among her best
clothes. There was a jug of stout on the table, and &rsquo;Erb poured Philip
out a glass. He wanted to give him the lion&rsquo;s share of the beefsteak, but
Philip insisted that they should share alike. It was a sunny room with two
windows that reached to the floor; it had been the parlour of a house which at
one time was if not fashionable at least respectable: it might have been
inhabited fifty years before by a well-to-do tradesman or an officer on half
pay. &rsquo;Erb had been a football player before he married, and there were
photographs on the wall of various teams in self-conscious attitudes, with
neatly plastered hair, the captain seated proudly in the middle holding a cup.
There were other signs of prosperity: photographs of the relations of
&rsquo;Erb and his wife in Sunday clothes; on the chimney-piece an elaborate
arrangement of shells stuck on a miniature rock; and on each side mugs,
&lsquo;A present from Southend&rsquo; in Gothic letters, with pictures of a
pier and a parade on them. &rsquo;Erb was something of a character; he was a
non-union man and expressed himself with indignation at the efforts of the
union to force him to join. The union wasn&rsquo;t no good to him, he never
found no difficulty in getting work, and there was good wages for anyone as
&rsquo;ad a head on his shoulders and wasn&rsquo;t above puttin&rsquo;
&rsquo;is &rsquo;and to anything as come &rsquo;is way. Polly was timorous. If
she was &rsquo;im she&rsquo;d join the union, the last time there was a strike
she was expectin&rsquo; &rsquo;im to be brought back in an ambulance every time
he went out. She turned to Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s that obstinate, there&rsquo;s no doing anything with
&rsquo;im.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what I say is, it&rsquo;s a free country, and I won&rsquo;t be
dictated to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good saying it&rsquo;s a free country,&rdquo; said Polly,
&ldquo;that won&rsquo;t prevent &rsquo;em bashin&rsquo; your &rsquo;ead in if
they get the chanst.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When they had finished Philip passed his pouch over to &rsquo;Erb and they lit
their pipes; then he got up, for a &lsquo;call&rsquo; might be waiting for him
at his rooms, and shook hands. He saw that it had given them pleasure that he
shared their meal, and they saw that he had thoroughly enjoyed it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, good-bye, sir,&rdquo; said &rsquo;Erb, &ldquo;and I &rsquo;ope we
shall &rsquo;ave as nice a doctor next time the missus disgraces
&rsquo;erself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go on with you, &rsquo;Erb,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;&rsquo;Ow
d&rsquo;you know there&rsquo;s going to be a next time?&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>CXIV</h2>

<p>
The three weeks which the appointment lasted drew to an end. Philip had
attended sixty-two cases, and he was tired out. When he came home about ten
o&rsquo;clock on his last night he hoped with all his heart that he would not
be called out again. He had not had a whole night&rsquo;s rest for ten days.
The case which he had just come from was horrible. He had been fetched by a
huge, burly man, the worse for liquor, and taken to a room in an evil-smelling
court, which was filthier than any he had seen: it was a tiny attic; most of
the space was taken up by a wooden bed, with a canopy of dirty red hangings,
and the ceiling was so low that Philip could touch it with the tips of his
fingers; with the solitary candle that afforded what light there was he went
over it, frizzling up the bugs that crawled upon it. The woman was a blowsy
creature of middle age, who had had a long succession of still-born children.
It was a story that Philip was not unaccustomed to: the husband had been a
soldier in India; the legislation forced upon that country by the prudery of
the English public had given a free run to the most distressing of all
diseases; the innocent suffered. Yawning, Philip undressed and took a bath,
then shook his clothes over the water and watched the animals that fell out
wriggling. He was just going to get into bed when there was a knock at the
door, and the hospital porter brought him a card.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Curse you,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the last person I
wanted to see tonight. Who&rsquo;s brought it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s the &rsquo;usband, sir. Shall I tell him to
wait?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip looked at the address, saw that the street was familiar to him, and told
the porter that he would find his own way. He dressed himself and in five
minutes, with his black bag in his hand, stepped into the street. A man, whom
he could not see in the darkness, came up to him, and said he was the husband.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d better wait, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a pretty rough neighbour&rsquo;ood, and them not knowing who you was.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bless your heart, they all know the doctor, I&rsquo;ve been in some
damned sight rougher places than Waver Street.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was quite true. The black bag was a passport through wretched alleys and
down foul-smelling courts into which a policeman was not ready to venture by
himself. Once or twice a little group of men had looked at Philip curiously as
he passed; he heard a mutter of observations and then one say:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the &rsquo;orspital doctor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As he went by one or two of them said: &ldquo;Good-night, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We shall &rsquo;ave to step out if you don&rsquo;t mind, sir,&rdquo;
said the man who accompanied him now. &ldquo;They told me there was no time to
lose.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why did you leave it so late?&rdquo; asked Philip, as he quickened his
pace.
</p>

<p>
He glanced at the fellow as they passed a lamp-post.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You look awfully young,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m turned eighteen, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was fair, and he had not a hair on his face, he looked no more than a boy;
he was short, but thick set.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re young to be married,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We &rsquo;ad to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How much d&rsquo;you earn?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sixteen, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sixteen shillings a week was not much to keep a wife and child on. The room the
couple lived in showed that their poverty was extreme. It was a fair size, but
it looked quite large, since there was hardly any furniture in it; there was no
carpet on the floor; there were no pictures on the walls; and most rooms had
something, photographs or supplements in cheap frames from the Christmas
numbers of the illustrated papers. The patient lay on a little iron bed of the
cheapest sort. It startled Philip to see how young she was.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove, she can&rsquo;t be more than sixteen,&rdquo; he said to the
woman who had come in to &lsquo;see her through.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
She had given her age as eighteen on the card, but when they were very young
they often put on a year or two. Also she was pretty, which was rare in those
classes in which the constitution has been undermined by bad food, bad air, and
unhealthy occupations; she had delicate features and large blue eyes, and a
mass of dark hair done in the elaborate fashion of the coster girl. She and her
husband were very nervous.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better wait outside, so as to be at hand if I want
you,&rdquo; Philip said to him.
</p>

<p>
Now that he saw him better Philip was surprised again at his boyish air: you
felt that he should be larking in the street with the other lads instead of
waiting anxiously for the birth of a child. The hours passed, and it was not
till nearly two that the baby was born. Everything seemed to be going
satisfactorily; the husband was called in, and it touched Philip to see the
awkward, shy way in which he kissed his wife; Philip packed up his things.
Before going he felt once more his patient&rsquo;s pulse.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hulloa!&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
He looked at her quickly: something had happened. In cases of emergency the S.
O. C.&mdash;senior obstetric clerk&mdash;had to be sent for; he was a qualified
man, and the &lsquo;district&rsquo; was in his charge. Philip scribbled a note,
and giving it to the husband, told him to run with it to the hospital; he bade
him hurry, for his wife was in a dangerous state. The man set off. Philip
waited anxiously; he knew the woman was bleeding to death; he was afraid she
would die before his chief arrived; he took what steps he could. He hoped
fervently that the S. O. C. would not have been called elsewhere. The minutes
were interminable. He came at last, and, while he examined the patient, in a
low voice asked Philip questions. Philip saw by his face that he thought the
case very grave. His name was Chandler. He was a tall man of few words, with a
long nose and a thin face much lined for his age. He shook his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was hopeless from the beginning. Where&rsquo;s the husband?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I told him to wait on the stairs,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better bring him in.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip opened the door and called him. He was sitting in the dark on the first
step of the flight that led to the next floor. He came up to the bed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s internal bleeding. It&rsquo;s impossible to stop
it.&rdquo; The S. O. C. hesitated a moment, and because it was a painful thing
to say he forced his voice to become brusque. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s dying.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The man did not say a word; he stopped quite still, looking at his wife, who
lay, pale and unconscious, on the bed. It was the midwife who spoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The gentlemen &rsquo;ave done all they could, &rsquo;Arry,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I saw what was comin&rsquo; from the first.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shut up,&rdquo; said Chandler.
</p>

<p>
There were no curtains on the windows, and gradually the night seemed to
lighten; it was not yet the dawn, but the dawn was at hand. Chandler was
keeping the woman alive by all the means in his power, but life was slipping
away from her, and suddenly she died. The boy who was her husband stood at the
end of the cheap iron bed with his hands resting on the rail; he did not speak;
but he looked very pale and once or twice Chandler gave him an uneasy glance,
thinking he was going to faint: his lips were gray. The midwife sobbed noisily,
but he took no notice of her. His eyes were fixed upon his wife, and in them
was an utter bewilderment. He reminded you of a dog whipped for something he
did not know was wrong. When Chandler and Philip had gathered together their
things Chandler turned to the husband.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better lie down for a bit. I expect you&rsquo;re about done
up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nowhere for me to lie down, sir,&rdquo; he answered, and
there was in his voice a humbleness which was very distressing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know anyone in the house who&rsquo;ll give you a
shakedown?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They only moved in last week,&rdquo; said the midwife. &ldquo;They
don&rsquo;t know nobody yet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Chandler hesitated a moment awkwardly, then he went up to the man and said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry this has happened.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He held out his hand and the man, with an instinctive glance at his own to see
if it was clean, shook it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip shook hands with him too. Chandler told the midwife to come and fetch
the certificate in the morning. They left the house and walked along together
in silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It upsets one a bit at first, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Chandler at
last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A bit,&rdquo; answered Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you like I&rsquo;ll tell the porter not to bring you any more calls
tonight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m off duty at eight in the morning in any case.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How many cases have you had?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sixty-three.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good. You&rsquo;ll get your certificate then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They arrived at the hospital, and the S. O. C. went in to see if anyone wanted
him. Philip walked on. It had been very hot all the day before, and even now in
the early morning there was a balminess in the air. The street was very still.
Philip did not feel inclined to go to bed. It was the end of his work and he
need not hurry. He strolled along, glad of the fresh air and the silence; he
thought that he would go on to the bridge and look at day break on the river. A
policeman at the corner bade him good-morning. He knew who Philip was from his
bag.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Out late tonight, sir,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
Philip nodded and passed. He leaned against the parapet and looked towards the
morning. At that hour the great city was like a city of the dead. The sky was
cloudless, but the stars were dim at the approach of day; there was a light
mist on the river, and the great buildings on the north side were like palaces
in an enchanted island. A group of barges was moored in midstream. It was all
of an unearthly violet, troubling somehow and awe-inspiring; but quickly
everything grew pale, and cold, and gray. Then the sun rose, a ray of yellow
gold stole across the sky, and the sky was iridescent. Philip could not get out
of his eyes the dead girl lying on the bed, wan and white, and the boy who
stood at the end of it like a stricken beast. The bareness of the squalid room
made the pain of it more poignant. It was cruel that a stupid chance should
have cut off her life when she was just entering upon it; but in the very
moment of saying this to himself, Philip thought of the life which had been in
store for her, the bearing of children, the dreary fight with poverty, the
youth broken by toil and deprivation into a slatternly middle age&mdash;he saw
the pretty face grow thin and white, the hair grow scanty, the pretty hands,
worn down brutally by work, become like the claws of an old animal&mdash;then,
when the man was past his prime, the difficulty of getting jobs, the small
wages he had to take; and the inevitable, abject penury of the end: she might
be energetic, thrifty, industrious, it would not have saved her; in the end was
the workhouse or subsistence on the charity of her children. Who could pity her
because she had died when life offered so little?
</p>

<p>
But pity was inane. Philip felt it was not that which these people needed. They
did not pity themselves. They accepted their fate. It was the natural order of
things. Otherwise, good heavens! otherwise they would swarm over the river in
their multitude to the side where those great buildings were, secure and
stately, and they would pillage, burn, and sack. But the day, tender and pale,
had broken now, and the mist was tenuous; it bathed everything in a soft
radiance; and the Thames was gray, rosy, and green; gray like mother-of-pearl
and green like the heart of a yellow rose. The wharfs and store-houses of the
Surrey Side were massed in disorderly loveliness. The scene was so exquisite
that Philip&rsquo;s heart beat passionately. He was overwhelmed by the beauty
of the world. Beside that nothing seemed to matter.

<p>
Philip spent the few weeks that remained before the beginning of the winter
session in the out-patients&rsquo; department, and in October settled down to
regular work. He had been away from the hospital for so long that he found
himself very largely among new people; the men of different years had little to
do with one another, and his contemporaries were now mostly qualified: some had
left to take up assistantships or posts in country hospitals and infirmaries,
and some held appointments at St. Luke&rsquo;s. The two years during which his
mind had lain fallow had refreshed him, he fancied, and he was able now to work
with energy.
</p>

<p>
The Athelnys were delighted with his change of fortune. He had kept aside a few
things from the sale of his uncle&rsquo;s effects and gave them all presents.
He gave Sally a gold chain that had belonged to his aunt. She was now grown up.
She was apprenticed to a dressmaker and set out every morning at eight to work
all day in a shop in Regent Street. Sally had frank blue eyes, a broad brow,
and plentiful shining hair; she was buxom, with broad hips and full breasts;
and her father, who was fond of discussing her appearance, warned her
constantly that she must not grow fat. She attracted because she was healthy,
animal, and feminine. She had many admirers, but they left her unmoved; she
gave one the impression that she looked upon love-making as nonsense; and it
was easy to imagine that young men found her unapproachable. Sally was old for
her years: she had been used to help her mother in the household work and in
the care of the children, so that she had acquired a managing air, which made
her mother say that Sally was a bit too fond of having things her own way. She
did not speak very much, but as she grew older she seemed to be acquiring a
quiet sense of humour, and sometimes uttered a remark which suggested that
beneath her impassive exterior she was quietly bubbling with amusement at her
fellow-creatures. Philip found that with her he never got on the terms of
affectionate intimacy upon which he was with the rest of Athelny&rsquo;s huge
family. Now and then her indifference slightly irritated him. There was
something enigmatic in her.
</p>

<p>
When Philip gave her the necklace Athelny in his boisterous way insisted that
she must kiss him; but Sally reddened and drew back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not going to,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ungrateful hussy!&rdquo; cried Athelny. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like being kissed by men,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
Philip saw her embarrassment, and, amused, turned Athelny&rsquo;s attention to
something else. That was never a very difficult thing to do. But evidently her
mother spoke of the matter later, for next time Philip came she took the
opportunity when they were alone for a couple of minutes to refer to it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think it disagreeable of me last week when I
wouldn&rsquo;t kiss you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; he laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not because I wasn&rsquo;t grateful.&rdquo; She blushed a
little as she uttered the formal phrase which she had prepared. &ldquo;I shall
always value the necklace, and it was very kind of you to give it me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip found it always a little difficult to talk to her. She did all that she
had to do very competently, but seemed to feel no need of conversation; yet
there was nothing unsociable in her. One Sunday afternoon when Athelny and his
wife had gone out together, and Philip, treated as one of the family, sat
reading in the parlour, Sally came in and sat by the window to sew. The
girls&rsquo; clothes were made at home and Sally could not afford to spend
Sundays in idleness. Philip thought she wished to talk and put down his book.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go on reading,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I only thought as you were alone
I&rsquo;d come and sit with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the most silent person I&rsquo;ve ever struck,&rdquo; said
Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want another one who&rsquo;s talkative in this
house,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
There was no irony in her tone: she was merely stating a fact. But it suggested
to Philip that she measured her father, alas, no longer the hero he was to her
childhood, and in her mind joined together his entertaining conversation and
the thriftlessness which often brought difficulties into their life; she
compared his rhetoric with her mother&rsquo;s practical common sense; and
though the liveliness of her father amused her she was perhaps sometimes a
little impatient with it. Philip looked at her as she bent over her work; she
was healthy, strong, and normal; it must be odd to see her among the other
girls in the shop with their flat chests and anaemic faces. Mildred suffered
from anaemia.
</p>

<p>
After a time it appeared that Sally had a suitor. She went out occasionally
with friends she had made in the work-room, and had met a young man, an
electrical engineer in a very good way of business, who was a most eligible
person. One day she told her mother that he had asked her to marry him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; said her mother.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I told him I wasn&rsquo;t over-anxious to marry anyone just yet
awhile.&rdquo; She paused a little as was her habit between observations.
&ldquo;He took on so that I said he might come to tea on Sunday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was an occasion that thoroughly appealed to Athelny. He rehearsed all the
afternoon how he should play the heavy father for the young man&rsquo;s
edification till he reduced his children to helpless giggling. Just before he
was due Athelny routed out an Egyptian tarboosh and insisted on putting it on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go on with you, Athelny,&rdquo; said his wife, who was in her best,
which was of black velvet, and, since she was growing stouter every year, very
tight for her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll spoil the girl&rsquo;s chances.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She tried to pull it off, but the little man skipped nimbly out of her way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Unhand me, woman. Nothing will induce me to take it off. This young man
must be shown at once that it is no ordinary family he is preparing to
enter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let him keep it on, mother,&rdquo; said Sally, in her even, indifferent
fashion. &ldquo;If Mr. Donaldson doesn&rsquo;t take it the way it&rsquo;s meant
he can take himself off, and good riddance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip thought it was a severe ordeal that the young man was being exposed to,
since Athelny, in his brown velvet jacket, flowing black tie, and red tarboosh,
was a startling spectacle for an innocent electrical engineer. When he came he
was greeted by his host with the proud courtesy of a Spanish grandee and by
Mrs. Athelny in an altogether homely and natural fashion. They sat down at the
old ironing-table in the high-backed monkish chairs, and Mrs. Athelny poured
tea out of a lustre teapot which gave a note of England and the country-side to
the festivity. She had made little cakes with her own hand, and on the table
was home-made jam. It was a farm-house tea, and to Philip very quaint and
charming in that Jacobean house. Athelny for some fantastic reason took it into
his head to discourse upon Byzantine history; he had been reading the later
volumes of the Decline and Fall; and, his forefinger dramatically extended, he
poured into the astonished ears of the suitor scandalous stories about Theodora
and Irene. He addressed himself directly to his guest with a torrent of
rhodomontade; and the young man, reduced to helpless silence and shy, nodded
his head at intervals to show that he took an intelligent interest. Mrs.
Athelny paid no attention to Thorpe&rsquo;s conversation, but interrupted now
and then to offer the young man more tea or to press upon him cake and jam.
Philip watched Sally; she sat with downcast eyes, calm, silent, and observant;
and her long eye-lashes cast a pretty shadow on her cheek. You could not tell
whether she was amused at the scene or if she cared for the young man. She was
inscrutable. But one thing was certain: the electrical engineer was
good-looking, fair and clean-shaven, with pleasant, regular features, and an
honest face; he was tall and well-made. Philip could not help thinking he would
make an excellent mate for her, and he felt a pang of envy for the happiness
which he fancied was in store for them.
</p>

<p>
Presently the suitor said he thought it was about time he was getting along.
Sally rose to her feet without a word and accompanied him to the door. When she
came back her father burst out:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Sally, we think your young man very nice. We are prepared to
welcome him into our family. Let the banns be called and I will compose a
nuptial song.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sally set about clearing away the tea-things. She did not answer. Suddenly she
shot a swift glance at Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did you think of him, Mr. Philip?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She had always refused to call him Uncle Phil as the other children did, and
would not call him Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d make an awfully handsome pair.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She looked at him quickly once more, and then with a slight blush went on with
her business.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought him a very nice civil-spoken young fellow,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Athelny, &ldquo;and I think he&rsquo;s just the sort to make any girl
happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sally did not reply for a minute or two, and Philip looked at her curiously: it
might be thought that she was meditating upon what her mother had said, and on
the other hand she might be thinking of the man in the moon.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you answer when you&rsquo;re spoken to, Sally?&rdquo;
remarked her mother, a little irritably.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought he was a silly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to have him then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how much more you want,&rdquo; said Mrs. Athelny, and
it was quite clear now that she was put out. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a very decent
young fellow and he can afford to give you a thorough good home. We&rsquo;ve
got quite enough to feed here without you. If you get a chance like that
it&rsquo;s wicked not to take it. And I daresay you&rsquo;d be able to have a
girl to do the rough work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip had never before heard Mrs. Athelny refer so directly to the
difficulties of her life. He saw how important it was that each child should be
provided for.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good your carrying on, mother,&rdquo; said Sally in her
quiet way. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to marry him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re a very hard-hearted, cruel, selfish girl.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you want me to earn my own living, mother, I can always go into
service.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so silly, you know your father would never let you do
that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip caught Sally&rsquo;s eye, and he thought there was in it a glimmer of
amusement. He wondered what there had been in the conversation to touch her
sense of humour. She was an odd girl.
</p>

<h2>CXVI</h2>

<p>
During his last year at St. Luke&rsquo;s Philip had to work hard. He was
contented with life. He found it very comfortable to be heart-free and to have
enough money for his needs. He had heard people speak contemptuously of money:
he wondered if they had ever tried to do without it. He knew that the lack made
a man petty, mean, grasping; it distorted his character and caused him to view
the world from a vulgar angle; when you had to consider every penny, money
became of grotesque importance: you needed a competency to rate it at its
proper value. He lived a solitary life, seeing no one except the Athelnys, but
he was not lonely; he busied himself with plans for the future, and sometimes
he thought of the past. His recollection dwelt now and then on old friends, but
he made no effort to see them. He would have liked to know what was become of
Norah Nesbit; she was Norah something else now, but he could not remember the
name of the man she was going to marry; he was glad to have known her: she was
a good and a brave soul. One evening about half past eleven he saw Lawson,
walking along Piccadilly; he was in evening clothes and might be supposed to be
coming back from a theatre. Philip gave way to a sudden impulse and quickly
turned down a side street. He had not seen him for two years and felt that he
could not now take up again the interrupted friendship. He and Lawson had
nothing more to say to one another. Philip was no longer interested in art; it
seemed to him that he was able to enjoy beauty with greater force than when he
was a boy; but art appeared to him unimportant. He was occupied with the
forming of a pattern out of the manifold chaos of life, and the materials with
which he worked seemed to make preoccupation with pigments and words very
trivial. Lawson had served his turn. Philip&rsquo;s friendship with him had
been a motive in the design he was elaborating: it was merely sentimental to
ignore the fact that the painter was of no further interest to him.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes Philip thought of Mildred. He avoided deliberately the streets in
which there was a chance of seeing her; but occasionally some feeling, perhaps
curiosity, perhaps something deeper which he would not acknowledge, made him
wander about Piccadilly and Regent Street during the hours when she might be
expected to be there. He did not know then whether he wished to see her or
dreaded it. Once he saw a back which reminded him of hers, and for a moment he
thought it was she; it gave him a curious sensation: it was a strange sharp
pain in his heart, there was fear in it and a sickening dismay; and when he
hurried on and found that he was mistaken he did not know whether it was relief
that he experienced or disappointment.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of August Philip passed his surgery, his last examination, and
received his diploma. It was seven years since he had entered St. Luke&rsquo;s
Hospital. He was nearly thirty. He walked down the stairs of the Royal College
of Surgeons with the roll in his hand which qualified him to practice, and his
heart beat with satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m really going to begin life,&rdquo; he thought.
</p>

<p>
Next day he went to the secretary&rsquo;s office to put his name down for one
of the hospital appointments. The secretary was a pleasant little man with a
black beard, whom Philip had always found very affable. He congratulated him on
his success, and then said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you wouldn&rsquo;t like to do a locum for a month on the South
coast? Three guineas a week with board and lodging.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s at Farnley, in Dorsetshire. Doctor South. You&rsquo;d have to
go down at once; his assistant has developed mumps. I believe it&rsquo;s a very
pleasant place.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was something in the secretary&rsquo;s manner that puzzled Philip. It was
a little doubtful.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the crab in it?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
The secretary hesitated a moment and laughed in a conciliating fashion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, the fact is, I understand he&rsquo;s rather a crusty, funny old
fellow. The agencies won&rsquo;t send him anyone any more. He speaks his mind
very openly, and men don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But d&rsquo;you think he&rsquo;ll be satisfied with a man who&rsquo;s
only just qualified? After all I have no experience.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He ought to be glad to get you,&rdquo; said the secretary
diplomatically.
</p>

<p>
Philip thought for a moment. He had nothing to do for the next few weeks, and
he was glad of the chance to earn a bit of money. He could put it aside for the
holiday in Spain which he had promised himself when he had finished his
appointment at St. Luke&rsquo;s or, if they would not give him anything there,
at some other hospital.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The only thing is, you must go this afternoon. Will that suit you? If
so, I&rsquo;ll send a wire at once.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip would have liked a few days to himself; but he had seen the Athelnys the
night before (he had gone at once to take them his good news) and there was
really no reason why he should not start immediately. He had little luggage to
pack. Soon after seven that evening he got out of the station at Farnley and
took a cab to Doctor South&rsquo;s. It was a broad low stucco house, with a
Virginia creeper growing over it. He was shown into the consulting-room. An old
man was writing at a desk. He looked up as the maid ushered Philip in. He did
not get up, and he did not speak; he merely stared at Philip. Philip was taken
aback.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re expecting me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The secretary
of St. Luke&rsquo;s wired to you this morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I kept dinner back for half an hour. D&rsquo;you want to wash?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
Doctor South amused him by his odd manner. He got up now, and Philip saw that
he was a man of middle height, thin, with white hair cut very short and a long
mouth closed so tightly that he seemed to have no lips at all; he was
clean-shaven but for small white whiskers, and they increased the squareness of
face which his firm jaw gave him. He wore a brown tweed suit and a white stock.
His clothes hung loosely about him as though they had been made for a much
larger man. He looked like a respectable farmer of the middle of the nineteenth
century. He opened the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is the dining-room,&rdquo; he said, pointing to the door opposite.
&ldquo;Your bed-room is the first door you come to when you get on the landing.
Come downstairs when you&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
During dinner Philip knew that Doctor South was examining him, but he spoke
little, and Philip felt that he did not want to hear his assistant talk.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When were you qualified?&rdquo; he asked suddenly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yesterday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Were you at a university?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Last year when my assistant took a holiday they sent me a &rsquo;Varsity
man. I told &rsquo;em not to do it again. Too damned gentlemanly for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was another pause. The dinner was very simple and very good. Philip
preserved a sedate exterior, but in his heart he was bubbling over with
excitement. He was immensely elated at being engaged as a locum; it made him
feel extremely grown up; he had an insane desire to laugh at nothing in
particular; and the more he thought of his professional dignity the more he was
inclined to chuckle.
</p>

<p>
But Doctor South broke suddenly into his thoughts. &ldquo;How old are
you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Getting on for thirty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How is it you&rsquo;re only just qualified?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t go in for the medical till I was nearly twenty-three, and
I had to give it up for two years in the middle.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poverty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Doctor South gave him an odd look and relapsed into silence. At the end of
dinner he got up from the table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you know what sort of a practice this is?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mostly fishermen and their families. I have the Union and the
Seamen&rsquo;s Hospital. I used to be alone here, but since they tried to make
this into a fashionable sea-side resort a man has set up on the cliff, and the
well-to-do people go to him. I only have those who can&rsquo;t afford to pay
for a doctor at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip saw that the rivalry was a sore point with the old man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know that I have no experience,&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You none of you know anything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He walked out of the room without another word and left Philip by himself. When
the maid came in to clear away she told Philip that Doctor South saw patients
from six till seven. Work for that night was over. Philip fetched a book from
his room, lit his pipe, and settled himself down to read. It was a great
comfort, since he had read nothing but medical books for the last few months.
At ten o&rsquo;clock Doctor South came in and looked at him. Philip hated not
to have his feet up, and he had dragged up a chair for them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You seem able to make yourself pretty comfortable,&rdquo; said Doctor
South, with a grimness which would have disturbed Philip if he had not been in
such high spirits.
</p>

<p>
Philip&rsquo;s eyes twinkled as he answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you any objection?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Doctor South gave him a look, but did not reply directly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re reading?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Peregrine Pickle. Smollett.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I happen to know that Smollett wrote Peregrine Pickle.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I beg your pardon. Medical men aren&rsquo;t much interested in
literature, are they?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip had put the book down on the table, and Doctor South took it up. It was
a volume of an edition which had belonged to the Vicar of Blackstable. It was a
thin book bound in faded morocco, with a copperplate engraving as a
frontispiece; the pages were musty with age and stained with mould. Philip,
without meaning to, started forward a little as Doctor South took the volume in
his hands, and a slight smile came into his eyes. Very little escaped the old
doctor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do I amuse you?&rdquo; he asked icily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see you&rsquo;re fond of books. You can always tell by the way people
handle them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
 Doctor South put down the novel immediately.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Breakfast at eight-thirty,&rdquo; he said and left the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a funny old fellow!&rdquo; thought Philip.
</p>

<p>
He soon discovered why Doctor South&rsquo;s assistants found it difficult to
get on with him. In the first place, he set his face firmly against all the
discoveries of the last thirty years: he had no patience with the drugs which
became modish, were thought to work marvellous cures, and in a few years were
discarded; he had stock mixtures which he had brought from St. Luke&rsquo;s
where he had been a student, and had used all his life; he found them just as
efficacious as anything that had come into fashion since. Philip was startled
at Doctor South&rsquo;s suspicion of asepsis; he had accepted it in deference
to universal opinion; but he used the precautions which Philip had known
insisted upon so scrupulously at the hospital with the disdainful tolerance of
a man playing at soldiers with children.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen antiseptics come along and sweep everything before them,
and then I&rsquo;ve seen asepsis take their place. Bunkum!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The young men who were sent down to him knew only hospital practice; and they
came with the unconcealed scorn for the General Practitioner which they had
absorbed in the air at the hospital; but they had seen only the complicated
cases which appeared in the wards; they knew how to treat an obscure disease of
the suprarenal bodies, but were helpless when consulted for a cold in the head.
Their knowledge was theoretical and their self-assurance unbounded. Doctor
South watched them with tightened lips; he took a savage pleasure in showing
them how great was their ignorance and how unjustified their conceit. It was a
poor practice, of fishing folk, and the doctor made up his own prescriptions.
Doctor South asked his assistant how he expected to make both ends meet if he
gave a fisherman with a stomach-ache a mixture consisting of half a dozen
expensive drugs. He complained too that the young medical men were uneducated:
their reading consisted of The Sporting Times and The British Medical Journal;
they could neither write a legible hand nor spell correctly. For two or three
days Doctor South watched Philip closely, ready to fall on him with acid
sarcasm if he gave him the opportunity; and Philip, aware of this, went about
his work with a quiet sense of amusement. He was pleased with the change of
occupation. He liked the feeling of independence and of responsibility. All
sorts of people came to the consulting-room. He was gratified because he seemed
able to inspire his patients with confidence; and it was entertaining to watch
the process of cure which at a hospital necessarily could be watched only at
distant intervals. His rounds took him into low-roofed cottages in which were
fishing tackle and sails and here and there mementoes of deep-sea travelling, a
lacquer box from Japan, spears and oars from Melanesia, or daggers from the
bazaars of Stamboul; there was an air of romance in the stuffy little rooms,
and the salt of the sea gave them a bitter freshness. Philip liked to talk to
the sailor-men, and when they found that he was not supercilious they told him
long yarns of the distant journeys of their youth.
</p>

<p>
Once or twice he made a mistake in diagnosis: (he had never seen a case of
measles before, and when he was confronted with the rash took it for an obscure
disease of the skin;) and once or twice his ideas of treatment differed from
Doctor South&rsquo;s. The first time this happened Doctor South attacked him
with savage irony; but Philip took it with good humour; he had some gift for
repartee, and he made one or two answers which caused Doctor South to stop and
look at him curiously. Philip&rsquo;s face was grave, but his eyes were
twinkling. The old gentleman could not avoid the impression that Philip was
chaffing him. He was used to being disliked and feared by his assistants, and
this was a new experience. He had half a mind to fly into a passion and pack
Philip off by the next train, he had done that before with his assistants; but
he had an uneasy feeling that Philip then would simply laugh at him outright;
and suddenly he felt amused. His mouth formed itself into a smile against his
will, and he turned away. In a little while he grew conscious that Philip was
amusing himself systematically at his expense. He was taken aback at first and
then diverted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Damn his impudence,&rdquo; he chuckled to himself. &ldquo;Damn his
impudence.&rdquo;
</p>

<h2>CXVII</h2>

<p>
Philip had written to Athelny to tell him that he was doing a locum in
Dorsetshire and in due course received an answer from him. It was written in
the formal manner he affected, studded with pompous epithets as a Persian
diadem was studded with precious stones; and in the beautiful hand, like black
letter and as difficult to read, upon which he prided himself. He suggested
that Philip should join him and his family in the Kentish hop-field to which he
went every year; and to persuade him said various beautiful and complicated
things about Philip&rsquo;s soul and the winding tendrils of the hops. Philip
replied at once that he would come on the first day he was free. Though not
born there, he had a peculiar affection for the Isle of Thanet, and he was
fired with enthusiasm at the thought of spending a fortnight so close to the
earth and amid conditions which needed only a blue sky to be as idyllic as the
olive groves of Arcady.
</p>

<p>
The four weeks of his engagement at Farnley passed quickly. On the cliff a new
town was springing up, with red brick villas round golf links, and a large
hotel had recently been opened to cater for the summer visitors; but Philip
went there seldom. Down below, by the harbour, the little stone houses of a
past century were clustered in a delightful confusion, and the narrow streets,
climbing down steeply, had an air of antiquity which appealed to the
imagination. By the water&rsquo;s edge were neat cottages with trim, tiny
gardens in front of them; they were inhabited by retired captains in the
merchant service, and by mothers or widows of men who had gained their living
by the sea; and they had an appearance which was quaint and peaceful. In the
little harbour came tramps from Spain and the Levant, ships of small tonnage;
and now and then a windjammer was borne in by the winds of romance. It reminded
Philip of the dirty little harbour with its colliers at Blackstable, and he
thought that there he had first acquired the desire, which was now an
obsession, for Eastern lands and sunlit islands in a tropic sea. But here you
felt yourself closer to the wide, deep ocean than on the shore of that North
Sea which seemed always circumscribed; here you could draw a long breath as you
looked out upon the even vastness; and the west wind, the dear soft salt wind
of England, uplifted the heart and at the same time melted it to tenderness.
</p>

<p>
One evening, when Philip had reached his last week with Doctor South, a child
came to the surgery door while the old doctor and Philip were making up
prescriptions. It was a little ragged girl with a dirty face and bare feet.
Philip opened the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Please, sir, will you come to Mrs. Fletcher&rsquo;s in Ivy Lane at
once?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Mrs. Fletcher?&rdquo; called out Doctor
South in his rasping voice.
</p>

<p>
The child took no notice of him, but addressed herself again to Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Please, sir, her little boy&rsquo;s had an accident and will you come at
once?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell Mrs. Fletcher I&rsquo;m coming,&rdquo; called out Doctor South.
</p>

<p>
The little girl hesitated for a moment, and putting a dirty finger in a dirty
mouth stood still and looked at Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Kid?&rdquo; said Philip, smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Please, sir, Mrs. Fletcher says, will the new doctor come?&rdquo; There
was a sound in the dispensary and Doctor South came out into the passage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Mrs. Fletcher satisfied with me?&rdquo; he barked.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve attended Mrs. Fletcher since she was born. Why aren&rsquo;t I
good enough to attend her filthy brat?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The little girl looked for a moment as though she were going to cry, then she
thought better of it; she put out her tongue deliberately at Doctor South, and,
before he could recover from his astonishment, bolted off as fast as she could
run. Philip saw that the old gentleman was annoyed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You look rather fagged, and it&rsquo;s a goodish way to Ivy Lane,&rdquo;
he said, by way of giving him an excuse not to go himself.
</p>

<p>
Doctor South gave a low snarl.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a damned sight nearer for a man who&rsquo;s got the use of
both legs than for a man who&rsquo;s only got one and a half.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip reddened and stood silent for a while.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you wish me to go or will you go yourself?&rdquo; he said at last
frigidly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good of my going? They want you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip took up his hat and went to see the patient. It was hard upon eight
o&rsquo;clock when he came back. Doctor South was standing in the dining-room
with his back to the fireplace.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been a long time,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. Why didn&rsquo;t you start dinner?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because I chose to wait. Have you been all this while at Mrs.
Fletcher&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m afraid I haven&rsquo;t. I stopped to look at the sunset on
my way back, and I didn&rsquo;t think of the time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Doctor South did not reply, and the servant brought in some grilled sprats.
Philip ate them with an excellent appetite. Suddenly Doctor South shot a
question at him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why did you look at the sunset?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip answered with his mouth full.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because I was happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Doctor South gave him an odd look, and the shadow of a smile flickered across
his old, tired face. They ate the rest of the dinner in silence; but when the
maid had given them the port and left the room, the old man leaned back and
fixed his sharp eyes on Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It stung you up a bit when I spoke of your game leg, young
fellow?&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;People always do, directly or indirectly, when they get angry with
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose they know it&rsquo;s your weak point.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip faced him and looked at him steadily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you very glad to have discovered it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The doctor did not answer, but he gave a chuckle of bitter mirth. They sat for
a while staring at one another. Then Doctor South surprised Philip extremely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you stay here and I&rsquo;ll get rid of that damned fool
with his mumps?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you, but I hope to get an appointment at the
hospital in the autumn. It&rsquo;ll help me so much in getting other work
later.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m offering you a partnership,&rdquo; said Doctor South grumpily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Philip, with surprise.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They seem to like you down here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think that was a fact which altogether met with your
approval,&rdquo; Philip said drily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;D&rsquo;you suppose that after forty years&rsquo; practice I care a
twopenny damn whether people prefer my assistant to me? No, my friend.
There&rsquo;s no sentiment between my patients and me. I don&rsquo;t expect
gratitude from them, I expect them to pay my fees. Well, what d&rsquo;you say
to it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip made no reply, not because he was thinking over the proposal, but
because he was astonished. It was evidently very unusual for someone to offer a
partnership to a newly qualified man; and he realised with wonder that,
although nothing would induce him to say so, Doctor South had taken a fancy to
him. He thought how amused the secretary at St. Luke&rsquo;s would be when he
told him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The practice brings in about seven hundred a year. We can reckon out how
much your share would be worth, and you can pay me off by degrees. And when I
die you can succeed me. I think that&rsquo;s better than knocking about
hospitals for two or three years, and then taking assistantships until you can
afford to set up for yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip knew it was a chance that most people in his profession would jump at;
the profession was over-crowded, and half the men he knew would be thankful to
accept the certainty of even so modest a competence as that.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry, but I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It
means giving up everything I&rsquo;ve aimed at for years. In one way and
another I&rsquo;ve had a roughish time, but I always had that one hope before
me, to get qualified so that I might travel; and now, when I wake in the
morning, my bones simply ache to get off, I don&rsquo;t mind where
particularly, but just away, to places I&rsquo;ve never been to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Now the goal seemed very near. He would have finished his appointment at St.
Luke&rsquo;s by the middle of the following year, and then he would go to
Spain; he could afford to spend several months there, rambling up and down the
land which stood to him for romance; after that he would get a ship and go to
the East. Life was before him and time of no account. He could wander, for
years if he chose, in unfrequented places, amid strange peoples, where life was
led in strange ways. He did not know what he sought or what his journeys would
bring him; but he had a feeling that he would learn something new about life
and gain some clue to the mystery that he had solved only to find more
mysterious. And even if he found nothing he would allay the unrest which gnawed
at his heart. But Doctor South was showing him a great kindness, and it seemed
ungrateful to refuse his offer for no adequate reason; so in his shy way,
trying to appear as matter of fact as possible, he made some attempt to explain
why it was so important to him to carry out the plans he had cherished so
passionately.
</p>

<p>
Doctor South listened quietly, and a gentle look came into his shrewd old eyes.
It seemed to Philip an added kindness that he did not press him to accept his
offer. Benevolence is often very peremptory. He appeared to look upon
Philip&rsquo;s reasons as sound. Dropping the subject, he began to talk of his
own youth; he had been in the Royal Navy, and it was his long connection with
the sea that, when he retired, had made him settle at Farnley. He told Philip
of old days in the Pacific and of wild adventures in China. He had taken part
in an expedition against the head-hunters of Borneo and had known Samoa when it
was still an independent state. He had touched at coral islands. Philip
listened to him entranced. Little by little he told Philip about himself.
Doctor South was a widower, his wife had died thirty years before, and his
daughter had married a farmer in Rhodesia; he had quarrelled with him, and she
had not come to England for ten years. It was just as if he had never had wife
or child. He was very lonely. His gruffness was little more than a protection
which he wore to hide a complete disillusionment; and to Philip it seemed
tragic to see him just waiting for death, not impatiently, but rather with
loathing for it, hating old age and unable to resign himself to its
limitations, and yet with the feeling that death was the only solution of the
bitterness of his life. Philip crossed his path, and the natural affection
which long separation from his daughter had killed&mdash;she had taken her
husband&rsquo;s part in the quarrel and her children he had never
seen&mdash;settled itself upon Philip. At first it made him angry, he told
himself it was a sign of dotage; but there was something in Philip that
attracted him, and he found himself smiling at him he knew not why. Philip did
not bore him. Once or twice he put his hand on his shoulder: it was as near a
caress as he had got since his daughter left England so many years before. When
the time came for Philip to go Doctor South accompanied him to the station: he
found himself unaccountably depressed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a ripping time here,&rdquo; said Philip.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been awfully kind to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re very glad to go?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve enjoyed myself here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you want to get out into the world? Ah, you have youth.&rdquo; He
hesitated a moment. &ldquo;I want you to remember that if you change your mind
my offer still stands.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s awfully kind of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip shook hands with him out of the carriage window, and the train steamed
out of the station. Philip thought of the fortnight he was going to spend in
the hop-field: he was happy at the idea of seeing his friends again, and he
rejoiced because the day was fine. But Doctor South walked slowly back to his
empty house. He felt very old and very lonely.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>CXVIII</h2>

<p>
It was late in the evening when Philip arrived at Ferne. It was Mrs.
Athelny&rsquo;s native village, and she had been accustomed from her childhood
to pick in the hop-field to which with her husband and her children she still
went every year. Like many Kentish folk her family had gone out regularly, glad
to earn a little money, but especially regarding the annual outing, looked
forward to for months, as the best of holidays. The work was not hard, it was
done in common, in the open air, and for the children it was a long, delightful
picnic; here the young men met the maidens; in the long evenings when work was
over they wandered about the lanes, making love; and the hopping season was
generally followed by weddings. They went out in carts with bedding, pots and
pans, chairs and tables; and Ferne while the hopping lasted was deserted. They
were very exclusive and would have resented the intrusion of foreigners, as
they called the people who came from London; they looked down upon them and
feared them too; they were a rough lot, and the respectable country folk did
not want to mix with them. In the old days the hoppers slept in barns, but ten
years ago a row of huts had been erected at the side of a meadow; and the
Athelnys, like many others, had the same hut every year.
</p>

<p>
Athelny met Philip at the station in a cart he had borrowed from the
public-house at which he had got a room for Philip. It was a quarter of a mile
from the hop-field. They left his bag there and walked over to the meadow in
which were the huts. They were nothing more than a long, low shed, divided into
little rooms about twelve feet square. In front of each was a fire of sticks,
round which a family was grouped, eagerly watching the cooking of supper. The
sea-air and the sun had browned already the faces of Athelny&rsquo;s children.
Mrs. Athelny seemed a different woman in her sun-bonnet: you felt that the long
years in the city had made no real difference to her; she was the country woman
born and bred, and you could see how much at home she found herself in the
country. She was frying bacon and at the same time keeping an eye on the
younger children, but she had a hearty handshake and a jolly smile for Philip.
Athelny was enthusiastic over the delights of a rural existence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re starved for sun and light in the cities we live in. It
isn&rsquo;t life, it&rsquo;s a long imprisonment. Let us sell all we have,
Betty, and take a farm in the country.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can see you in the country,&rdquo; she answered with good-humoured
scorn. &ldquo;Why, the first rainy day we had in the winter you&rsquo;d be
crying for London.&rdquo; She turned to Philip. &ldquo;Athelny&rsquo;s always
like this when we come down here. Country, I like that! Why, he don&rsquo;t
know a swede from a mangel-wurzel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Daddy was lazy today,&rdquo; remarked Jane, with the frankness which
characterized her, &ldquo;he didn&rsquo;t fill one bin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting into practice, child, and tomorrow I shall fill more
bins than all of you put together.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come and eat your supper, children,&rdquo; said Mrs. Athelny.
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Sally?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here I am, mother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She stepped out of their little hut, and the flames of the wood fire leaped up
and cast sharp colour upon her face. Of late Philip had only seen her in the
trim frocks she had taken to since she was at the dressmaker&rsquo;s, and there
was something very charming in the print dress she wore now, loose and easy to
work in; the sleeves were tucked up and showed her strong, round arms. She too
had a sun-bonnet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You look like a milkmaid in a fairy story,&rdquo; said Philip, as he
shook hands with her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the belle of the hop-fields,&rdquo; said Athelny. &ldquo;My
word, if the Squire&rsquo;s son sees you he&rsquo;ll make you an offer of
marriage before you can say Jack Robinson.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Squire hasn&rsquo;t got a son, father,&rdquo; said Sally.
</p>

<p>
She looked about for a place to sit down in, and Philip made room for her
beside him. She looked wonderful in the night lit by wood fires. She was like
some rural goddess, and you thought of those fresh, strong girls whom old
Herrick had praised in exquisite numbers. The supper was simple, bread and
butter, crisp bacon, tea for the children, and beer for Mr. and Mrs. Athelny
and Philip. Athelny, eating hungrily, praised loudly all he ate. He flung words
of scorn at Lucullus and piled invectives upon Brillat-Savarin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing one can say for you, Athelny,&rdquo; said his
wife, &ldquo;you do enjoy your food and no mistake!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Cooked by your hand, my Betty,&rdquo; he said, stretching out an
eloquent forefinger.
</p>

<p>
Philip felt himself very comfortable. He looked happily at the line of fires,
with people grouped about them, and the colour of the flames against the night;
at the end of the meadow was a line of great elms, and above the starry sky.
The children talked and laughed, and Athelny, a child among them, made them
roar by his tricks and fancies.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They think a rare lot of Athelny down here,&rdquo; said his wife.
&ldquo;Why, Mrs. Bridges said to me, I don&rsquo;t know what we should do
without Mr. Athelny now, she said. He&rsquo;s always up to something,
he&rsquo;s more like a schoolboy than the father of a family.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sally sat in silence, but she attended to Philip&rsquo;s wants in a thoughtful
fashion that charmed him. It was pleasant to have her beside him, and now and
then he glanced at her sunburned, healthy face. Once he caught her eyes, and
she smiled quietly. When supper was over Jane and a small brother were sent
down to a brook that ran at the bottom of the meadow to fetch a pail of water
for washing up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You children, show your Uncle Philip where we sleep, and then you must
be thinking of going to bed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Small hands seized Philip, and he was dragged towards the hut. He went in and
struck a match. There was no furniture in it; and beside a tin box, in which
clothes were kept, there was nothing but the beds; there were three of them,
one against each wall. Athelny followed Philip in and showed them proudly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the stuff to sleep on,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;None of your
spring-mattresses and swansdown. I never sleep so soundly anywhere as here. YOU
will sleep between sheets. My dear fellow, I pity you from the bottom of my
soul.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The beds consisted of a thick layer of hopvine, on the top of which was a
coating of straw, and this was covered with a blanket. After a day in the open
air, with the aromatic scent of the hops all round them, the happy pickers
slept like tops. By nine o&rsquo;clock all was quiet in the meadow and everyone
in bed but one or two men who still lingered in the public-house and would not
come back till it was closed at ten. Athelny walked there with Philip. But
before he went Mrs. Athelny said to him:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We breakfast about a quarter to six, but I daresay you won&rsquo;t want
to get up as early as that. You see, we have to set to work at six.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course he must get up early,&rdquo; cried Athelny, &ldquo;and he must
work like the rest of us. He&rsquo;s got to earn his board. No work, no dinner,
my lad.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The children go down to bathe before breakfast, and they can give you a
call on their way back. They pass The Jolly Sailor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If they&rsquo;ll wake me I&rsquo;ll come and bathe with them,&rdquo;
said Philip.
</p>

<p>
Jane and Harold and Edward shouted with delight at the prospect, and next
morning Philip was awakened out of a sound sleep by their bursting into his
room. The boys jumped on his bed, and he had to chase them out with his
slippers. He put on a coat and a pair of trousers and went down. The day had
only just broken, and there was a nip in the air; but the sky was cloudless,
and the sun was shining yellow. Sally, holding Connie&rsquo;s hand, was
standing in the middle of the road, with a towel and a bathing-dress over her
arm. He saw now that her sun-bonnet was of the colour of lavender, and against
it her face, red and brown, was like an apple. She greeted him with her slow,
sweet smile, and he noticed suddenly that her teeth were small and regular and
very white. He wondered why they had never caught his attention before.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was for letting you sleep on,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but they would
go up and wake you. I said you didn&rsquo;t really want to come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, yes, I did.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They walked down the road and then cut across the marshes. That way it was
under a mile to the sea. The water looked cold and gray, and Philip shivered at
the sight of it; but the others tore off their clothes and ran in shouting.
Sally did everything a little slowly, and she did not come into the water till
all the rest were splashing round Philip. Swimming was his only accomplishment;
he felt at home in the water; and soon he had them all imitating him as he
played at being a porpoise, and a drowning man, and a fat lady afraid of
wetting her hair. The bathe was uproarious, and it was necessary for Sally to
be very severe to induce them all to come out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re as bad as any of them,&rdquo; she said to Philip, in her
grave, maternal way, which was at once comic and touching. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
not anything like so naughty when you&rsquo;re not here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They walked back, Sally with her bright hair streaming over one shoulder and
her sun-bonnet in her hand, but when they got to the huts Mrs. Athelny had
already started for the hop-garden. Athleny, in a pair of the oldest trousers
anyone had ever worn, his jacket buttoned up to show he had no shirt on, and in
a wide-brimmed soft hat, was frying kippers over a fire of sticks. He was
delighted with himself: he looked every inch a brigand. As soon as he saw the
party he began to shout the witches&rsquo; chorus from Macbeth over the odorous
kippers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t dawdle over your breakfast or mother will be
angry,&rdquo; he said, when they came up.
</p>

<p>
And in a few minutes, Harold and Jane with pieces of bread and butter in their
hands, they sauntered through the meadow into the hop-field. They were the last
to leave. A hop-garden was one of the sights connected with Philip&rsquo;s
boyhood and the oast-houses to him the most typical feature of the Kentish
scene. It was with no sense of strangeness, but as though he were at home, that
Philip followed Sally through the long lines of the hops. The sun was bright
now and cast a sharp shadow. Philip feasted his eyes on the richness of the
green leaves. The hops were yellowing, and to him they had the beauty and the
passion which poets in Sicily have found in the purple grape. As they walked
along Philip felt himself overwhelmed by the rich luxuriance. A sweet scent
arose from the fat Kentish soil, and the fitful September breeze was heavy with
the goodly perfume of the hops. Athelstan felt the exhilaration instinctively,
for he lifted up his voice and sang; it was the cracked voice of the boy of
fifteen, and Sally turned round.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You be quiet, Athelstan, or we shall have a thunderstorm.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In a moment they heard the hum of voices, and in a moment more came upon the
pickers. They were all hard at work, talking and laughing as they picked. They
sat on chairs, on stools, on boxes, with their baskets by their sides, and some
stood by the bin throwing the hops they picked straight into it. There were a
lot of children about and a good many babies, some in makeshift cradles, some
tucked up in a rug on the soft brown dry earth. The children picked a little
and played a great deal. The women worked busily, they had been pickers from
childhood, and they could pick twice as fast as foreigners from London. They
boasted about the number of bushels they had picked in a day, but they
complained you could not make money now as in former times: then they paid you
a shilling for five bushels, but now the rate was eight and even nine bushels
to the shilling. In the old days a good picker could earn enough in the season
to keep her for the rest of the year, but now there was nothing in it; you got
a holiday for nothing, and that was about all. Mrs. Hill had bought herself a
pianner out of what she made picking, so she said, but she was very near, one
wouldn&rsquo;t like to be near like that, and most people thought it was only
what she said, if the truth was known perhaps it would be found that she had
put a bit of money from the savings bank towards it.
</p>

<p>
The hoppers were divided into bin companies of ten pickers, not counting
children, and Athelny loudly boasted of the day when he would have a company
consisting entirely of his own family. Each company had a bin-man, whose duty
it was to supply it with strings of hops at their bins (the bin was a large
sack on a wooden frame, about seven feet high, and long rows of them were
placed between the rows of hops;) and it was to this position that Athelny
aspired when his family was old enough to form a company. Meanwhile he worked
rather by encouraging others than by exertions of his own. He sauntered up to
Mrs. Athelny, who had been busy for half an hour and had already emptied a
basket into the bin, and with his cigarette between his lips began to pick. He
asserted that he was going to pick more than anyone that day, but mother; of
course no one could pick so much as mother; that reminded him of the trials
which Aphrodite put upon the curious Psyche, and he began to tell his children
the story of her love for the unseen bridegroom. He told it very well. It
seemed to Philip, listening with a smile on his lips, that the old tale fitted
in with the scene. The sky was very blue now, and he thought it could not be
more lovely even in Greece. The children with their fair hair and rosy cheeks,
strong, healthy, and vivacious; the delicate form of the hops; the challenging
emerald of the leaves, like a blare of trumpets; the magic of the green alley,
narrowing to a point as you looked down the row, with the pickers in their
sun-bonnets: perhaps there was more of the Greek spirit there than you could
find in the books of professors or in museums. He was thankful for the beauty
of England. He thought of the winding white roads and the hedgerows, the green
meadows with their elm-trees, the delicate line of the hills and the copses
that crowned them, the flatness of the marshes, and the melancholy of the North
Sea. He was very glad that he felt its loveliness. But presently Athelny grew
restless and announced that he would go and ask how Robert Kemp&rsquo;s mother
was. He knew everyone in the garden and called them all by their Christian
names; he knew their family histories and all that had happened to them from
birth. With harmless vanity he played the fine gentleman among them, and there
was a touch of condescension in his familiarity. Philip would not go with him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to earn my dinner,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite right, my boy,&rdquo; answered Athelny, with a wave of the hand,
as he strolled away. &ldquo;No work, no dinner.&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>CXIX</h2>

<p>
Philip had not a basket of his own, but sat with Sally. Jane thought it
monstrous that he should help her elder sister rather than herself, and he had
to promise to pick for her when Sally&rsquo;s basket was full. Sally was almost
as quick as her mother.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it hurt your hands for sewing?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, no, it wants soft hands. That&rsquo;s why women pick better than
men. If your hands are hard and your fingers all stiff with a lot of rough work
you can&rsquo;t pick near so well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He liked to see her deft movements, and she watched him too now and then with
that maternal spirit of hers which was so amusing and yet so charming. He was
clumsy at first, and she laughed at him. When she bent over and showed him how
best to deal with a whole line their hands met. He was surprised to see her
blush. He could not persuade himself that she was a woman; because he had known
her as a flapper, he could not help looking upon her as a child still; yet the
number of her admirers showed that she was a child no longer; and though they
had only been down a few days one of Sally&rsquo;s cousins was already so
attentive that she had to endure a lot of chaffing. His name was Peter Gann,
and he was the son of Mrs. Athelny&rsquo;s sister, who had married a farmer
near Ferne. Everyone knew why he found it necessary to walk through the
hop-field every day.
</p>

<p>
A call-off by the sounding of a horn was made for breakfast at eight, and
though Mrs. Athelny told them they had not deserved it, they ate it very
heartily. They set to work again and worked till twelve, when the horn sounded
once more for dinner. At intervals the measurer went his round from bin to bin,
accompanied by the booker, who entered first in his own book and then in the
hopper&rsquo;s the number of bushels picked. As each bin was filled it was
measured out in bushel baskets into a huge bag called a poke; and this the
measurer and the pole-puller carried off between them and put on the waggon.
Athelny came back now and then with stories of how much Mrs. Heath or Mrs.
Jones had picked, and he conjured his family to beat her: he was always wanting
to make records, and sometimes in his enthusiasm picked steadily for an hour.
His chief amusement in it, however, was that it showed the beauty of his
graceful hands, of which he was excessively proud. He spent much time
manicuring them. He told Philip, as he stretched out his tapering fingers, that
the Spanish grandees had always slept in oiled gloves to preserve their
whiteness. The hand that wrung the throat of Europe, he remarked dramatically,
was as shapely and exquisite as a woman&rsquo;s; and he looked at his own, as
he delicately picked the hops, and sighed with self-satisfaction. When he grew
tired of this he rolled himself a cigarette and discoursed to Philip of art and
literature. In the afternoon it grew very hot. Work did not proceed so actively
and conversation halted. The incessant chatter of the morning dwindled now to
desultory remarks. Tiny beads of sweat stood on Sally&rsquo;s upper lip, and as
she worked her lips were slightly parted. She was like a rosebud bursting into
flower.
</p>

<p>
Calling-off time depended on the state of the oast-house. Sometimes it was
filled early, and as many hops had been picked by three or four as could be
dried during the night. Then work was stopped. But generally the last measuring
of the day began at five. As each company had its bin measured it gathered up
its things and, chatting again now that work was over, sauntered out of the
garden. The women went back to the huts to clean up and prepare the supper,
while a good many of the men strolled down the road to the public-house. A
glass of beer was very pleasant after the day&rsquo;s work.
</p>

<p>
The Athelnys&rsquo; bin was the last to be dealt with. When the measurer came
Mrs. Athelny, with a sigh of relief, stood up and stretched her arms: she had
been sitting in the same position for many hours and was stiff.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s go to The Jolly Sailor,&rdquo; said Athelny. &ldquo;The
rites of the day must be duly performed, and there is none more sacred than
that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Take a jug with you, Athelny,&rdquo; said his wife, &ldquo;and bring
back a pint and a half for supper.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She gave him the money, copper by copper. The bar-parlour was already well
filled. It had a sanded floor, benches round it, and yellow pictures of
Victorian prize-fighters on the walls. The licencee knew all his customers by
name, and he leaned over his bar smiling benignly at two young men who were
throwing rings on a stick that stood up from the floor: their failure was
greeted with a good deal of hearty chaff from the rest of the company. Room was
made for the new arrivals. Philip found himself sitting between an old labourer
in corduroys, with string tied under his knees, and a shiny-faced lad of
seventeen with a love-lock neatly plastered on his red forehead. Athelny
insisted on trying his hand at the throwing of rings. He backed himself for
half a pint and won it. As he drank the loser&rsquo;s health he said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I would sooner have won this than won the Derby, my boy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was an outlandish figure, with his wide-brimmed hat and pointed beard, among
those country folk, and it was easy to see that they thought him very queer;
but his spirits were so high, his enthusiasm so contagious, that it was
impossible not to like him. Conversation went easily. A certain number of
pleasantries were exchanged in the broad, slow accent of the Isle of Thanet,
and there was uproarious laughter at the sallies of the local wag. A pleasant
gathering! It would have been a hard-hearted person who did not feel a glow of
satisfaction in his fellows. Philip&rsquo;s eyes wandered out of the window
where it was bright and sunny still; there were little white curtains in it
tied up with red ribbon like those of a cottage window, and on the sill were
pots of geraniums. In due course one by one the idlers got up and sauntered
back to the meadow where supper was cooking.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I expect you&rsquo;ll be ready for your bed,&rdquo; said Mrs. Athelny to
Philip. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not used to getting up at five and staying in the
open air all day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming to bathe with us, Uncle Phil, aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; the boys cried.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rather.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was tired and happy. After supper, balancing himself against the wall of the
hut on a chair without a back, he smoked his pipe and looked at the night.
Sally was busy. She passed in and out of the hut, and he lazily watched her
methodical actions. Her walk attracted his notice; it was not particularly
graceful, but it was easy and assured; she swung her legs from the hips, and
her feet seemed to tread the earth with decision. Athelny had gone off to
gossip with one of the neighbours, and presently Philip heard his wife address
the world in general.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There now, I&rsquo;m out of tea and I wanted Athelny to go down to Mrs.
Black&rsquo;s and get some.&rdquo; A pause, and then her voice was raised:
&ldquo;Sally, just run down to Mrs. Black&rsquo;s and get me half a pound of
tea, will you? I&rsquo;ve run quite out of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, mother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Black had a cottage about half a mile along the road, and she combined the
office of postmistress with that of universal provider. Sally came out of the
hut, turning down her sleeves.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall I come with you, Sally?&rdquo; asked Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you trouble. I&rsquo;m not afraid to go alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you were; but it&rsquo;s getting near my bedtime,
and I was just thinking I&rsquo;d like to stretch my legs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sally did not answer, and they set out together. The road was white and silent.
There was not a sound in the summer night. They did not speak much.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite hot even now, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s wonderful for the time of year.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But their silence did not seem awkward. They found it was pleasant to walk side
by side and felt no need of words. Suddenly at a stile in the hedgerow they
heard a low murmur of voices, and in the darkness they saw the outline of two
people. They were sitting very close to one another and did not move as Philip
and Sally passed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder who that was,&rdquo; said Sally.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They looked happy enough, didn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I expect they took us for lovers too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They saw the light of the cottage in front of them, and in a minute went into
the little shop. The glare dazzled them for a moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are late,&rdquo; said Mrs. Black. &ldquo;I was just going to shut
up.&rdquo; She looked at the clock. &ldquo;Getting on for nine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sally asked for her half pound of tea (Mrs. Athelny could never bring herself
to buy more than half a pound at a time), and they set off up the road again.
Now and then some beast of the night made a short, sharp sound, but it seemed
only to make the silence more marked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I believe if you stood still you could hear the sea,&rdquo; said Sally.
</p>

<p>
They strained their ears, and their fancy presented them with a faint sound of
little waves lapping up against the shingle. When they passed the stile again
the lovers were still there, but now they were not speaking; they were in one
another&rsquo;s arms, and the man&rsquo;s lips were pressed against the
girl&rsquo;s.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They seem busy,&rdquo; said Sally.
</p>

<p>
They turned a corner, and a breath of warm wind beat for a moment against their
faces. The earth gave forth its freshness. There was something strange in the
tremulous night, and something, you knew not what, seemed to be waiting; the
silence was on a sudden pregnant with meaning. Philip had a queer feeling in
his heart, it seemed very full, it seemed to melt (the hackneyed phrases
expressed precisely the curious sensation), he felt happy and anxious and
expectant. To his memory came back those lines in which Jessica and Lorenzo
murmur melodious words to one another, capping each other&rsquo;s utterance;
but passion shines bright and clear through the conceits that amuse them. He
did not know what there was in the air that made his senses so strangely alert;
it seemed to him that he was pure soul to enjoy the scents and the sounds and
the savours of the earth. He had never felt such an exquisite capacity for
beauty. He was afraid that Sally by speaking would break the spell, but she
said never a word, and he wanted to hear the sound of her voice. Its low
richness was the voice of the country night itself.
</p>

<p>
They arrived at the field through which she had to walk to get back to the
huts. Philip went in to hold the gate open for her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, here I think I&rsquo;ll say good-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you for coming all that way with me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She gave him her hand, and as he took it, he said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you were very nice you&rsquo;d kiss me good-night like the rest of
the family.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
Philip had spoken in jest. He merely wanted to kiss her, because he was happy
and he liked her and the night was so lovely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-night then,&rdquo; he said, with a little laugh, drawing her
towards him.
</p>

<p>
She gave him her lips; they were warm and full and soft; he lingered a little,
they were like a flower; then, he knew not how, without meaning it, he flung
his arms round her. She yielded quite silently. Her body was firm and strong.
He felt her heart beat against his. Then he lost his head. His senses
overwhelmed him like a flood of rushing waters. He drew her into the darker
shadow of the hedge.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2>CXX</h2>

<p>
Philip slept like a log and awoke with a start to find Harold tickling his face
with a feather. There was a shout of delight when he opened his eyes. He was
drunken with sleep.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come on, lazybones,&rdquo; said Jane. &ldquo;Sally says she won&rsquo;t
wait for you unless you hurry up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then he remembered what had happened. His heart sank, and, half out of bed
already, he stopped; he did not know how he was going to face her; he was
overwhelmed with a sudden rush of self-reproach, and bitterly, bitterly, he
regretted what he had done. What would she say to him that morning? He dreaded
meeting her, and he asked himself how he could have been such a fool. But the
children gave him no time; Edward took his bathing-drawers and his towel,
Athelstan tore the bed-clothes away; and in three minutes they all clattered
down into the road. Sally gave him a smile. It was as sweet and innocent as it
had ever been.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You do take a time to dress yourself,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I thought
you was never coming.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was not a particle of difference in her manner. He had expected some
change, subtle or abrupt; he fancied that there would be shame in the way she
treated him, or anger, or perhaps some increase of familiarity; but there was
nothing. She was exactly the same as before. They walked towards the sea all
together, talking and laughing; and Sally was quiet, but she was always that,
reserved, but he had never seen her otherwise, and gentle. She neither sought
conversation with him nor avoided it. Philip was astounded. He had expected the
incident of the night before to have caused some revolution in her, but it was
just as though nothing had happened; it might have been a dream; and as he
walked along, a little girl holding on to one hand and a little boy to the
other, while he chatted as unconcernedly as he could, he sought for an
explanation. He wondered whether Sally meant the affair to be forgotten.
Perhaps her senses had run away with her just as his had, and, treating what
had occurred as an accident due to unusual circumstances, it might be that she
had decided to put the matter out of her mind. It was ascribing to her a power
of thought and a mature wisdom which fitted neither with her age nor with her
character. But he realised that he knew nothing of her. There had been in her
always something enigmatic.
</p>

<p>
They played leap-frog in the water, and the bathe was as uproarious as on the
previous day. Sally mothered them all, keeping a watchful eye on them, and
calling to them when they went out too far. She swam staidly backwards and
forwards while the others got up to their larks, and now and then turned on her
back to float. Presently she went out and began drying herself; she called to
the others more or less peremptorily, and at last only Philip was left in the
water. He took the opportunity to have a good hard swim. He was more used to
the cold water this second morning, and he revelled in its salt freshness; it
rejoiced him to use his limbs freely, and he covered the water with long, firm
strokes. But Sally, with a towel round her, went down to the water&rsquo;s
edge.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re to come out this minute, Philip,&rdquo; she called, as
though he were a small boy under her charge.
</p>

<p>
And when, smiling with amusement at her authoritative way, he came towards her,
she upbraided him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is naughty of you to stay in so long. Your lips are quite blue, and
just look at your teeth, they&rsquo;re chattering.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll come out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She had never talked to him in that manner before. It was as though what had
happened gave her a sort of right over him, and she looked upon him as a child
to be cared for. In a few minutes they were dressed, and they started to walk
back. Sally noticed his hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just look, they&rsquo;re quite blue.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right. It&rsquo;s only the circulation. I shall get
the blood back in a minute.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give them to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She took his hands in hers and rubbed them, first one and then the other, till
the colour returned. Philip, touched and puzzled, watched her. He could not say
anything to her on account of the children, and he did not meet her eyes; but
he was sure they did not avoid his purposely, it just happened that they did
not meet. And during the day there was nothing in her behaviour to suggest a
consciousness in her that anything had passed between them. Perhaps she was a
little more talkative than usual. When they were all sitting again in the
hop-field she told her mother how naughty Philip had been in not coming out of
the water till he was blue with cold. It was incredible, and yet it seemed that
the only effect of the incident of the night before was to arouse in her a
feeling of protection towards him: she had the same instinctive desire to
mother him as she had with regard to her brothers and sisters.
</p>

<p>
It was not till the evening that he found himself alone with her. She was
cooking the supper, and Philip was sitting on the grass by the side of the
fire. Mrs. Athelny had gone down to the village to do some shopping, and the
children were scattered in various pursuits of their own. Philip hesitated to
speak. He was very nervous. Sally attended to her business with serene
competence and she accepted placidly the silence which to him was so
embarrassing. He did not know how to begin. Sally seldom spoke unless she was
spoken to or had something particular to say. At last he could not bear it any
longer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not angry with me, Sally?&rdquo; he blurted out suddenly.
</p>

<p>
She raised her eyes quietly and looked at him without emotion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Me? No. Why should I be?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was taken aback and did not reply. She took the lid off the pot, stirred the
contents, and put it on again. A savoury smell spread over the air. She looked
at him once more, with a quiet smile which barely separated her lips; it was
more a smile of the eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I always liked you,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
His heart gave a great thump against his ribs, and he felt the blood rushing to
his cheeks. He forced a faint laugh.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re a silly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you liked me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t either.&rdquo; She put a little more wood on the fire.
&ldquo;I knew I liked you that day you came when you&rsquo;d been sleeping out
and hadn&rsquo;t had anything to eat, d&rsquo;you remember? And me and mother,
we got Thorpy&rsquo;s bed ready for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He flushed again, for he did not know that she was aware of that incident. He
remembered it himself with horror and shame.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I wouldn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the others.
You remember that young fellow mother wanted me to have? I let him come to tea
because he bothered so, but I knew I&rsquo;d say no.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Philip was so surprised that he found nothing to say. There was a queer feeling
in his heart; he did not know what it was, unless it was happiness. Sally
stirred the pot once more.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish those children would make haste and come. I don&rsquo;t know
where they&rsquo;ve got to. Supper&rsquo;s ready now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall I go and see if I can find them?&rdquo; said Philip.
</p>

<p>
It was a relief to talk about practical things.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea, I must say…. There&rsquo;s mother
coming.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then, as he got up, she looked at him without embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall I come for a walk with you tonight when I&rsquo;ve put the
children to bed?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you wait for me down by the stile, and I&rsquo;ll come when
I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He waited under the stars, sitting on the stile, and the hedges with their
ripening blackberries were high on each side of him. From the earth rose rich
scents of the night, and the air was soft and still. His heart was beating
madly. He could not understand anything of what happened to him. He associated
passion with cries and tears and vehemence, and there was nothing of this in
Sally; but he did not know what else but passion could have caused her to give
herself. But passion for him? He would not have been surprised if she had
fallen to her cousin, Peter Gann, tall, spare, and straight, with his sunburned
face and long, easy stride. Philip wondered what she saw in him. He did not
know if she loved him as he reckoned love. And yet? He was convinced of her
purity. He had a vague inkling that many things had combined, things that she
felt though was unconscious of, the intoxication of the air and the hops and
the night, the healthy instincts of the natural woman, a tenderness that
overflowed, and an affection that had in it something maternal and something
sisterly; and she gave all she had to give because her heart was full of
charity.
</p>

<p>
He heard a step on the road, and a figure came out of the darkness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sally,&rdquo; he murmured.
</p>

<p>
She stopped and came to the stile, and with her came sweet, clean odours of the
country-side. She seemed to carry with her scents of the new-mown hay, and the
savour of ripe hops, and the freshness of young grass. Her lips were soft and
full against his, and her lovely, strong body was firm within his arms.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Milk and honey,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re like milk and
honey.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He made her close her eyes and kissed her eyelids, first one and then the
other. Her arm, strong and muscular, was bare to the elbow; he passed his hand
over it and wondered at its beauty; it gleamed in the darkness; she had the
skin that Rubens painted, astonishingly fair and transparent, and on one side
were little golden hairs. It was the arm of a Saxon goddess; but no immortal
had that exquisite, homely naturalness; and Philip thought of a cottage garden
with the dear flowers which bloom in all men&rsquo;s hearts, of the hollyhock
and the red and white rose which is called York and Lancaster, and of
love&mdash;in-a-mist and Sweet William, and honeysuckle, larkspur, and London
Pride.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can you care for me?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m insignificant
and crippled and ordinary and ugly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She took his face in both her hands and kissed his lips.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an old silly, that&rsquo;s what you are,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<h2>CXXI</h2>

<p>
When the hops were picked, Philip with the news in his pocket that he had got
the appointment as assistant house-physician at St. Luke&rsquo;s, accompanied
the Athelnys back to London. He took modest rooms in Westminster and at the
beginning of October entered upon his duties. The work was interesting and
varied; every day he learned something new; he felt himself of some
consequence; and he saw a good deal of Sally. He found life uncommonly
pleasant. He was free about six, except on the days on which he had
out-patients, and then he went to the shop at which Sally worked to meet her
when she came out. There were several young men, who hung about opposite the
&lsquo;trade entrance&rsquo; or a little further along, at the first corner;
and the girls, coming out two and two or in little groups, nudged one another
and giggled as they recognised them. Sally in her plain black dress looked very
different from the country lass who had picked hops side by side with him. She
walked away from the shop quickly, but she slackened her pace when they met,
and greeted him with her quiet smile. They walked together through the busy
street. He talked to her of his work at the hospital, and she told him what she
had been doing in the shop that day. He came to know the names of the girls she
worked with. He found that Sally had a restrained, but keen, sense of the
ridiculous, and she made remarks about the girls or the men who were set over
them which amused him by their unexpected drollery. She had a way of saying a
thing which was very characteristic, quite gravely, as though there were
nothing funny in it at all, and yet it was so sharp-sighted that Philip broke
into delighted laughter. Then she would give him a little glance in which the
smiling eyes showed she was not unaware of her own humour. They met with a
handshake and parted as formally. Once Philip asked her to come and have tea
with him in his rooms, but she refused.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t do that. It would look funny.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Never a word of love passed between them. She seemed not to desire anything
more than the companionship of those walks. Yet Philip was positive that she
was glad to be with him. She puzzled him as much as she had done at the
beginning. He did not begin to understand her conduct; but the more he knew her
the fonder he grew of her; she was competent and self controlled, and there was
a charming honesty in her: you felt that you could rely upon her in every
circumstance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are an awfully good sort,&rdquo; he said to her once a propos of
nothing at all.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I expect I&rsquo;m just the same as everyone else,&rdquo; she answered.
</p>

<p>
He knew that he did not love her. It was a great affection that he felt for
her, and he liked her company; it was curiously soothing; and he had a feeling
for her which seemed to him ridiculous to entertain towards a shop-girl of
nineteen: he respected her. And he admired her magnificent healthiness. She was
a splendid animal, without defect; and physical perfection filled him always
with admiring awe. She made him feel unworthy.
</p>

<p>
Then, one day, about three weeks after they had come back to London as they
walked together, he noticed that she was unusually silent. The serenity of her
expression was altered by a slight line between the eyebrows: it was the
beginning of a frown.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Sally?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
She did not look at him, but straight in front of her, and her colour darkened.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He understood at once what she meant. His heart gave a sudden, quick beat, and
he felt the colour leave his cheeks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you mean? Are you afraid that… ?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He stopped. He could not go on. The possibility that anything of the sort could
happen had never crossed his mind. Then he saw that her lips were trembling,
and she was trying not to cry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not certain yet. Perhaps it&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They walked on in silence till they came to the corner of Chancery Lane, where
he always left her. She held out her hand and smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it yet. Let&rsquo;s hope for the best.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He walked away with a tumult of thoughts in his head. What a fool he had been!
That was the first thing that struck him, an abject, miserable fool, and he
repeated it to himself a dozen times in a rush of angry feeling. He despised
himself. How could he have got into such a mess? But at the same time, for his
thoughts chased one another through his brain and yet seemed to stand together,
in a hopeless confusion, like the pieces of a jig-saw puzzle seen in a
nightmare, he asked himself what he was going to do. Everything was so clear
before him, all he had aimed at so long within reach at last, and now his
inconceivable stupidity had erected this new obstacle. Philip had never been
able to surmount what he acknowledged was a defect in his resolute desire for a
well ordered life, and that was his passion for living in the future; and no
sooner was he settled in his work at the hospital than he had busied himself
with arrangements for his travels. In the past he had often tried not to think
too circumstantially of his plans for the future, it was only discouraging; but
now that his goal was so near he saw no harm in giving away to a longing that
was so difficult to resist. First of all he meant to go to Spain. That was the
land of his heart; and by now he was imbued with its spirit, its romance and
colour and history and grandeur; he felt that it had a message for him in
particular which no other country could give. He knew the fine old cities
already as though he had trodden their tortuous streets from childhood.
Cordova, Seville, Toledo, Leon, Tarragona, Burgos. The great painters of Spain
were the painters of his soul, and his pulse beat quickly as he pictured his
ecstasy on standing face to face with those works which were more significant
than any others to his own tortured, restless heart. He had read the great
poets, more characteristic of their race than the poets of other lands; for
they seemed to have drawn their inspiration not at all from the general
currents of the world&rsquo;s literature but directly from the torrid, scented
plains and the bleak mountains of their country. A few short months now, and he
would hear with his own ears all around him the language which seemed most apt
for grandeur of soul and passion. His fine taste had given him an inkling that
Andalusia was too soft and sensuous, a little vulgar even, to satisfy his
ardour; and his imagination dwelt more willingly among the wind-swept distances
of Castile and the rugged magnificence of Aragon and Leon. He did not know
quite what those unknown contacts would give him, but he felt that he would
gather from them a strength and a purpose which would make him more capable of
affronting and comprehending the manifold wonders of places more distant and
more strange.
</p>

<p>
For this was only a beginning. He had got into communication with the various
companies which took surgeons out on their ships, and knew exactly what were
their routes, and from men who had been on them what were the advantages and
disadvantages of each line. He put aside the Orient and the P. &amp; O. It was
difficult to get a berth with them; and besides their passenger traffic allowed
the medical officer little freedom; but there were other services which sent
large tramps on leisurely expeditions to the East, stopping at all sorts of
ports for various periods, from a day or two to a fortnight, so that you had
plenty of time, and it was often possible to make a trip inland. The pay was
poor and the food no more than adequate, so that there was not much demand for
the posts, and a man with a London degree was pretty sure to get one if he
applied. Since there were no passengers other than a casual man or so, shipping
on business from some out-of-the-way port to another, the life on board was
friendly and pleasant. Philip knew by heart the list of places at which they
touched; and each one called up in him visions of tropical sunshine, and magic
colour, and of a teeming, mysterious, intense life. Life! That was what he
wanted. At last he would come to close quarters with Life. And perhaps, from
Tokyo or Shanghai it would be possible to tranship into some other line and
drip down to the islands of the South Pacific. A doctor was useful anywhere.
There might be an opportunity to go up country in Burmah, and what rich jungles
in Sumatra or Borneo might he not visit? He was young still and time was no
object to him. He had no ties in England, no friends; he could go up and down
the world for years, learning the beauty and the wonder and the variedness of
life.
</p>

<p>
Now this thing had come. He put aside the possibility that Sally was mistaken;
he felt strangely certain that she was right; after all, it was so likely;
anyone could see that Nature had built her to be the mother of children. He
knew what he ought to do. He ought not to let the incident divert him a
hair&rsquo;s breadth from his path. He thought of Griffiths; he could easily
imagine with what indifference that young man would have received such a piece
of news; he would have thought it an awful nuisance and would at once have
taken to his heels, like a wise fellow; he would have left the girl to deal
with her troubles as best she could. Philip told himself that if this had
happened it was because it was inevitable. He was no more to blame than Sally;
she was a girl who knew the world and the facts of life, and she had taken the
risk with her eyes open. It would be madness to allow such an accident to
disturb the whole pattern of his life. He was one of the few people who was
acutely conscious of the transitoriness of life, and how necessary it was to
make the most of it. He would do what he could for Sally; he could afford to
give her a sufficient sum of money. A strong man would never allow himself to
be turned from his purpose.
</p>

<p>
Philip said all this to himself, but he knew he could not do it. He simply
could not. He knew himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so damned weak,&rdquo; he muttered despairingly.
</p>

<p>
She had trusted him and been kind to him. He simply could not do a thing which,
notwithstanding all his reason, he felt was horrible. He knew he would have no
peace on his travels if he had the thought constantly with him that she was
wretched. Besides, there were her father and mother: they had always treated
him well; it was not possible to repay them with ingratitude. The only thing
was to marry Sally as quickly as possible. He would write to Doctor South, tell
him he was going to be married at once, and say that if his offer still held he
was willing to accept it. That sort of practice, among poor people, was the
only one possible for him; there his deformity did not matter, and they would
not sneer at the simple manners of his wife. It was curious to think of her as
his wife, it gave him a queer, soft feeling; and a wave of emotion spread over
him as he thought of the child which was his. He had little doubt that Doctor
South would be glad to have him, and he pictured to himself the life he would
lead with Sally in the fishing village. They would have a little house within
sight of the sea, and he would watch the mighty ships passing to the lands he
would never know. Perhaps that was the wisest thing. Cronshaw had told him that
the facts of life mattered nothing to him who by the power of fancy held in fee
the twin realms of space and time. It was true. Forever wilt thou love and she
be fair!
</p>

<p>
His wedding present to his wife would be all his high hopes. Self-sacrifice!
Philip was uplifted by its beauty, and all through the evening he thought of
it. He was so excited that he could not read. He seemed to be driven out of his
rooms into the streets, and he walked up and down Birdcage Walk, his heart
throbbing with joy. He could hardly bear his impatience. He wanted to see
Sally&rsquo;s happiness when he made her his offer, and if it had not been so
late he would have gone to her there and then. He pictured to himself the long
evenings he would spend with Sally in the cosy sitting-room, the blinds undrawn
so that they could watch the sea; he with his books, while she bent over her
work, and the shaded lamp made her sweet face more fair. They would talk over
the growing child, and when she turned her eyes to his there was in them the
light of love. And the fishermen and their wives who were his patients would
come to feel a great affection for them, and they in their turn would enter
into the pleasures and pains of those simple lives. But his thoughts returned
to the son who would be his and hers. Already he felt in himself a passionate
devotion to it. He thought of passing his hands over his little perfect limbs,
he knew he would be beautiful; and he would make over to him all his dreams of
a rich and varied life. And thinking over the long pilgrimage of his past he
accepted it joyfully. He accepted the deformity which had made life so hard for
him; he knew that it had warped his character, but now he saw also that by
reason of it he had acquired that power of introspection which had given him so
much delight. Without it he would never have had his keen appreciation of
beauty, his passion for art and literature, and his interest in the varied
spectacle of life. The ridicule and the contempt which had so often been heaped
upon him had turned his mind inward and called forth those flowers which he
felt would never lose their fragrance. Then he saw that the normal was the
rarest thing in the world. Everyone had some defect, of body or of mind: he
thought of all the people he had known (the whole world was like a sick-house,
and there was no rhyme or reason in it), he saw a long procession, deformed in
body and warped in mind, some with illness of the flesh, weak hearts or weak
lungs, and some with illness of the spirit, languor of will, or a craving for
liquor. At this moment he could feel a holy compassion for them all. They were
the helpless instruments of blind chance. He could pardon Griffiths for his
treachery and Mildred for the pain she had caused him. They could not help
themselves. The only reasonable thing was to accept the good of men and be
patient with their faults. The words of the dying God crossed his memory:
</p>

<p>
Forgive them, for they know not what they do.

<h2>CXXII</h2>

<p>
He had arranged to meet Sally on Saturday in the National Gallery. She was to
come there as soon as she was released from the shop and had agreed to lunch
with him. Two days had passed since he had seen her, and his exultation had not
left him for a moment. It was because he rejoiced in the feeling that he had
not attempted to see her. He had repeated to himself exactly what he would say
to her and how he should say it. Now his impatience was unbearable. He had
written to Doctor South and had in his pocket a telegram from him received that
morning: &ldquo;Sacking the mumpish fool. When will you come?&rdquo; Philip
walked along Parliament Street. It was a fine day, and there was a bright,
frosty sun which made the light dance in the street. It was crowded. There was
a tenuous mist in the distance, and it softened exquisitely the noble lines of
the buildings. He crossed Trafalgar Square. Suddenly his heart gave a sort of
twist in his body; he saw a woman in front of him who he thought was Mildred.
She had the same figure, and she walked with that slight dragging of the feet
which was so characteristic of her. Without thinking, but with a beating heart,
he hurried till he came alongside, and then, when the woman turned, he saw it
was someone unknown to him. It was the face of a much older person, with a
lined, yellow skin. He slackened his pace. He was infinitely relieved, but it
was not only relief that he felt; it was disappointment too; he was seized with
horror of himself. Would he never be free from that passion? At the bottom of
his heart, notwithstanding everything, he felt that a strange, desperate thirst
for that vile woman would always linger. That love had caused him so much
suffering that he knew he would never, never quite be free of it. Only death
could finally assuage his desire.
</p>

<p>
But he wrenched the pang from his heart. He thought of Sally, with her kind
blue eyes; and his lips unconsciously formed themselves into a smile. He walked
up the steps of the National Gallery and sat down in the first room, so that he
should see her the moment she came in. It always comforted him to get among
pictures. He looked at none in particular, but allowed the magnificence of
their colour, the beauty of their lines, to work upon his soul. His imagination
was busy with Sally. It would be pleasant to take her away from that London in
which she seemed an unusual figure, like a cornflower in a shop among orchids
and azaleas; he had learned in the Kentish hop-field that she did not belong to
the town; and he was sure that she would blossom under the soft skies of Dorset
to a rarer beauty. She came in, and he got up to meet her. She was in black,
with white cuffs at her wrists and a lawn collar round her neck. They shook
hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you been waiting long?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No. Ten minutes. Are you hungry?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not very.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sit here for a bit, shall we?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They sat quietly, side by side, without speaking. Philip enjoyed having her
near him. He was warmed by her radiant health. A glow of life seemed like an
aureole to shine about her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, how have you been?&rdquo; he said at last, with a little smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all right. It was a false alarm.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Was it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you glad?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
An extraordinary sensation filled him. He had felt certain that Sally&rsquo;s
suspicion was well-founded; it had never occurred to him for an instant that
there was a possibility of error. All his plans were suddenly overthrown, and
the existence, so elaborately pictured, was no more than a dream which would
never be realised. He was free once more. Free! He need give up none of his
projects, and life still was in his hands for him to do what he liked with. He
felt no exhilaration, but only dismay. His heart sank. The future stretched out
before him in desolate emptiness. It was as though he had sailed for many years
over a great waste of waters, with peril and privation, and at last had come
upon a fair haven, but as he was about to enter, some contrary wind had arisen
and drove him out again into the open sea; and because he had let his mind
dwell on these soft meads and pleasant woods of the land, the vast deserts of
the ocean filled him with anguish. He could not confront again the loneliness
and the tempest. Sally looked at him with her clear eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you glad?&rdquo; she asked again. &ldquo;I thought
you&rsquo;d be as pleased as Punch.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He met her gaze haggardly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; he muttered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are funny. Most men would.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He realised that he had deceived himself; it was no self-sacrifice that had
driven him to think of marrying, but the desire for a wife and a home and love;
and now that it all seemed to slip through his fingers he was seized with
despair. He wanted all that more than anything in the world. What did he care
for Spain and its cities, Cordova, Toledo, Leon; what to him were the pagodas
of Burmah and the lagoons of South Sea Islands? America was here and now. It
seemed to him that all his life he had followed the ideals that other people,
by their words or their writings, had instilled into him, and never the desires
of his own heart. Always his course had been swayed by what he thought he
should do and never by what he wanted with his whole soul to do. He put all
that aside now with a gesture of impatience. He had lived always in the future,
and the present always, always had slipped through his fingers. His ideals? He
thought of his desire to make a design, intricate and beautiful, out of the
myriad, meaningless facts of life: had he not seen also that the simplest
pattern, that in which a man was born, worked, married, had children, and died,
was likewise the most perfect? It might be that to surrender to happiness was
to accept defeat, but it was a defeat better than many victories.
</p>

<p>
He glanced quickly at Sally, he wondered what she was thinking, and then looked
away again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was going to ask you to marry me,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought p&rsquo;raps you might, but I shouldn&rsquo;t have liked to
stand in your way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have done that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How about your travels, Spain and all that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How d&rsquo;you know I want to travel?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I ought to know something about it. I&rsquo;ve heard you and Dad talk
about it till you were blue in the face.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a damn about all that.&rdquo; He paused for an
instant and then spoke in a low, hoarse whisper. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to
leave you! I can&rsquo;t leave you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She did not answer. He could not tell what she thought.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wonder if you&rsquo;ll marry me, Sally.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She did not move and there was no flicker of emotion on her face, but she did
not look at him when she answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, of course I&rsquo;d like to have a house of my own, and it&rsquo;s
about time I was settling down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He smiled a little. He knew her pretty well by now, and her manner did not
surprise him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you want to marry ME?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one else I would marry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then that settles it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mother and Dad will be surprised, won&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want my lunch,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He smiled and took her hand and pressed it. They got up and walked out of the
gallery. They stood for a moment at the balustrade and looked at Trafalgar
Square. Cabs and omnibuses hurried to and fro, and crowds passed, hastening in
every direction, and the sun was shining.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
