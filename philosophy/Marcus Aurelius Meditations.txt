Marcus Aurelius' Meditations 



1. You percieve in others the things that you chose to percieve in yourself.
2. You can't have total control over something isn't yours. Because your mind is the only thing you actually own, you can only fully manage it with practice.
3. Don't despise others since they are a part of the universe. What you think about people is mirrored in your body language and facial gestures towards them, and they can tell it.
