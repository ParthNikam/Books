A collection of some of the books I've read.



## Introduction

Welcome to my "Books" repository! Here, I've curated a list of some of the books I've read over time. This is not only a personal record but also an opportunity to share book recommendations with others who share similar interests in reading.

## Books

You can find the list of books I've read in the [BOOKS.md](BOOKS.md) file. Each book includes a brief description and my personal thoughts or reviews. Feel free to explore and discover new reading material.

## How to Use

1. **Browse the Book List**: Simply navigate to the repo to explore the books I've read.

2. **Contribute**: If you've read a book that's not on the list or have thoughts to share about a book I've listed, please consider contributing. Fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

3. **Recommendations**: Have a book you think I should read? Feel free to open an issue with your recommendation, and I'll consider adding it to my reading list.
